V93SYj2OLh5m9Cquzf-7kg,ZwVz20be-hOZnyAbevyMyQ,2c9Vptks_vowLgVUMnCgjw,Came here while in town for a country concert.  What better way to start our day.  Everything was great.  The service was amazing from the time we walked in the door.  We were sat at a table and to our surprise there is a beer and whiskey tap at the table.  You pay by the ounce and there is a screen to show you what you've drank.  The food we had was great.  The whiskey burger was my favorite.  For you country fans this is a must when in Scottsdale!,4,2013-09-04 1:29

CqMNjtG0hNZGhDw4RDE-zw,_Jg-IA0M-GSjBlGu-wmejg,r8764MtYyt8JhxMvrfM_xQ,"I was really disappointed with my most recent visit to Vintage 95. I make it out there every six months or so and always talk it up to friends. Tonight I went with my husband and in-laws. We ordered a carafe of sangria, which as always was top notch. My in-laws ordered bruschetta - they ended up with a ton of untoasted bread with a very thin coat of ricotta and a light topping of good quality tomatoes. Tasty but not bruschetta and definitely not worth $14. My husband and I got the ""artisan board"" with one meat and one cheese. For $13, we got a teeny tiny piece of cheese, four thin slices of not-so-good sopressata, stale bread, 2 crackers, raw unsalted almonds, six grapes, and about half a jar of very oniony cornichons! The food was a huge rip-off, and not at all the quality or quantity we have gotten in the past. The saving grace of the night was the sangria, which I still think is one of the best in the area. But overall, I don't think this place is worth a trip out anymore.",2,2014-10-11 3:53

- Quality - Excellent. No fishy smell on my food or in the restaurant. Delicious. Rolls were well made and tasty!
- Quantity - I walked out STUFFED from eating the $9.99 lunch special.
- Price - Can't beat $10 for lunch, especially this much good sushi.

But the takeout side of things was not as good.
The teeny tiny salad had wilted lettuce. The takeout version of the Sakana lunch does not include miso soup, although the price is the same, and they did not include chopsticks, napkins, or soy sauce.",4,2015-03-04 19:36

Our Nishikawa Black Ramen bowl was everything I hope it would be in this chilly, rainy winter evening after a day spent hiking in the rain.  It was rich and deep, full of interesting flavors and textures and all the umami I dreamed of.  

The spring rolls and gyoza were also yummy but the star of the show was definitely ramen.

It was soooo busy tonight, we were seated fairly quickly and our food came out fast.  Our waitress forgot our drink orders and didn't really check on us but I'm sure she saw we were busy slurping our noodles.  The restaurant is clean and small.  The prices are good!

I had breakfast; eggs, two sausage links, potatoes and coffee.  The coffee was Guatemalan, and was killer good.  Eggs were scrambled perfectly.  The sausages were huge, and VERY good, but a bit too spicy for me (I'm a wimp).  I ate the better part of one sausage before I had to stop.  But the star of the breakfast was the potatoes - chunky with rosemary and sea salt.  So simple, yet SO delicious.  I will get the breakfast with bacon next time, as they serve applewood smoked.  The toast was their 9-grain, and it was so good, I bought a loaf.  And they used real butter on the bread!  This is the location we will come back to!",5,2015-01-03 22:07

We again sat outside on the patio that overlooks the canal. It was perfect. The service was excellent and the waiter was very attentive without hovering. The food was perfect. My husband ordered the rib-eye steak and said it was cooked to perfection and very tender. I ordered two vegetarian appetizers, hummus with vegetables and the flatbread. The margherita flatbread rates among the best I have ever eaten.  I am so glad we were asked to give this establishment a second visit.

While not extremely simple to find, this hidden gem in Scottsdale is worth the time to seek out. Their menu is very easily broken down into main ingredient such as chicken, seafood, lamb, etc... I had the Goa Prawns and they were delicious. The shrimp themselves were generically good but the sauce they were in was fantastic. Spicy but not too spicy, flavorful but not too flavorful, and excellently paired with some rice and the awesome and highly recommended garlic naan. My partner had the coconut chicken curry and garlic and onion naan, which I had bites of and both were very very yummy. 

Friday night they have a belly dancer which added a fun and unique element to the dining experience. I would highly recommend trying this place out for either lunch or dinner. I know I will be paying them many many more visits to come.",5,2017-08-07 20:11

They have a very interesting menu, it seems pretty standard diner fare but it is obvious that they provide fresh, healthy options whenever possible. 

My friend and I went for lunch yesterday and we both had burgers. I had a bacon cheeseburger subbed with bleu cheese, my friend had an ostrich burger. I liked hers, l you could tell it is a leaner meat, but it was a little too birdy for me; I will stick to my moo burger.  I ordered my burger medium and it was done exactly so. Both were served on wheat buns. I also had the ""Famous"" tortilla soup which was very good with wonton chips on top, and also tried my dining partner's white chili which was made with chicken.

The service was very friendly and efficient even during the downtown lunch rush. The bathrooms are cute but tiny, and you enter through the kitchen. This isn't a place I will crave, but definitely somewhere I'd stop by again for a nice outdoor lunch (except they allow smoking on the patio..ick. is that even legal? Definitely not 25 feet from the door...)",3,2008-12-03 15:35

I love their salads - the Mediterranean Chicken Salad is my absolute fave. Their Broiled Chicken Salad is also good if if you're looking for something a little more simple. I frequently order these but have also had their Lavosh Pizza, which is tasty too.

As far as starters go, you can't go to Pita Jungle and not get their hummus and pita. The best hummus flavors are the regular and the cilantro ones. I've also had their Spanakopita (fillo dough with spinach and feta) which is great - but can't be good for you!

I enjoy both dining in or takeout for either lunch or dinner. Keep in mind, eating inside here, it gets pretty loud. If the weather is nice, I would suggest eating on the patio.",4,2012-02-01 6:08

I got a coffee, the breakfast blend...
And the Costa breakfast burrito which came with potatoes

We had about a 30 minute wait for an inside table so we decided to grab a seat at the bar and get a drink. My girlfriend ordered a glass of wine, my boyfriend ordered a vodka/tonic and our friend ordered another pretty easy drink. I ordered the white sangria and the first sip was off-putting a bit. It tasted like sweet and sour mix was added. I had a few other sips as well as my girlfriend and boyfriend and they both agreed it wasn't right. We asked the bartender to just make me a vodka/water. Much better. 

We were seated right at the 30 minute mark. Since we were not too hungry for all of us to get entrees we decided on some small plates to share. We decided on the Lamb Meatballs, Bacon wrapped Dates (two orders of those), an order of 3 different bruschetta, (Prosciutto & Fog, Fresh Mozzarella & Manchego), and our friend ordered the chicken Cesar salad.

Our go to order is Mongolian Beef and Sweet and Sour Chicken (it's seriously award winning!!). If you choose to go in and dine, the people that work there are so friendly.

We went on a Friday about 7pm with a group of 5, took about 20 min to seat us because the place was packed. 

The rolls were yummy. My hubby disliked the sashimi because the ones he grabbed had been on the conveyor too long and were warm. Its biggest feature is also its biggest drawback. They should have some sort of marking system for when dishes go out, so that if they're not picked up by anyone fast enough they toss them. 

It took them a while to get the check and they had issues splitting it.",3,2010-08-20 23:53

Even though I'm the worst at golf, it's always an enjoyable time to hang out with friends, maybe enjoy a nice night outside, drink some alcohol, and hit some golf balls. The music is good and always lively! 

It's today's new ""bowling alley"" and I'm so glad they have one in Gilbert now! Can't wait to go to that one and see if it's the same thing as this scottsdale location. 

They have two bars, one large bar downstairs and one smaller bar upstairs where the booth/range things are! The downstairs bar is pretty cool to chill with friends while waiting for your table! The bar upstairs is not really needed once you actually get your booth cause the waiter/waitress can take care of your drinks from there!

The food is actually not bad here too! There are a lot of snacks and foods that are easily shareable with more than 6 people! It's gets kinda pricey though so be careful not to over-order at first! 

Overall I LOVE Topgolf, and I'll always end up here every so often!

Tips:
1) Go at night! It's wayyyy cooler, and you get to see the neon lights and stuff!
2) If you're going on Friday or Saturday at night, MAKE A RESERVATION ONLINE! It's so easy! Or else you'll have to wait for at least an hour
3) Get the cheese fries, it's probably the best snack food to get there
4) If you're celebrating a birthday or something, call in advance! They can help you set up your booth and stuff if you have balloons, cake, etc

-fWRkGkGBUAxMS-7UPwC_Q,X754C7UkbPik6ppvYaIitA,cPEo3-TmIqCwHLFGKZgwGg,"I give 3.5 to 4 stars for food. But for service, it is probably a 2-star or less for me. 

SERVICE:

Being Chinese, I know service is never the forte of an authentic Chinese restaurant. But I was still surprised at the lack of service and the total carelessness and cluelessness there. First, they don't seem to care which table orders what so the orders frequently got mixed up when I was there; the server would carry the food and wander around from table to table, asking if anyone ordered this. So I had to watch the plates whenever the server carried them out from the kitchen and stopped her to give mine to me, because the server was walking AWAY from me with my food on her tray. 

Second, they started making dumplings 40 minutes after I ordered them. After the dumplings were finally ready, because they forgot who ordered it or simply did not care to check, they let it sit on the side table behind the cashier for another 15 minutes. Our dumplings were finally uncovered when the owner saw the dumplings sitting in the cashier area and started talking loudly in Chinese, ""Whose dumplings are these?"" I had to raise my hand to claim them. So we got our dumplings after we finished our meal and were about to pay the bill.

Third, it was difficult to get hold of a server/owner to ask if the dish was coming out anytime soon. They rushed by your table and never made any eye contact. They don't come by your table and fill your water diligently, or check on your order. The owner was especially warm and hospitable to her acquainted clientele when I was there, but was quite indifferent to others (I guess I shouldn't be surprised how they selectively treat people... in the Chinese way).

FOOD:

In terms of food, I don't have major complaints. The food was good, quite authentic, and fairly priced. But if you ask me to compare Chou's Kitchen to the street food I had growing up in China, Chou's does not come close in taste and quality.

We ordered 

(1) Spicy Braised Beef Combination (in Chinese, ""sliced lung by the married couple,"" a dish in chili oil, toasted peanuts, and cilantro with a mixture of beef slices and various beef parts, including stomach--it sounds gross but I dare you to try it). The best dish we got that night. To me, it was not spicy enough because it is traditionally a very hot dish from Sichuan Province. But the flavor was there and I was thrilled to see a dish Chinese restaurants in the U.S. don't normally serve, even though this is a STANDARD appetizer in almost any restaurant in China.

(2) Lamb skewer. Pretty disappointed. It has the similar cumin rub as the ones I would buy from the Xinjiang Uyghur vendors on a street cart in China. But the quality of the lamb was so bad and almost inedible: it was predominantly fat and connective tissues, and the very small amount of lean meat was tough and overcooked.

(3) Fried beef buns (in Chinese, ""water-fried beef buns""). So-so. Too much dough for my liking and too little filling. Also, not juicy enough.

(4) Soybean Paste Noodle (a soupless ""mix-it-yourself"" cold noodle with cubed ham, sliced cucumber, and a soybean meat sauce). It was extremely basic. The noodle was an alkaline noodle, so it was yellower and more elastic than the average soup noodles. It was a filling dish, but nothing special, and quite bland.

(5) Dumplings with Pork and Napa Cabbage. Yes these are the dumplings that came grossly late so we had to box all of them. For 5 bucks they were great, much better than the ones from the frozen section at a Chinese grocery store. But they were NOT worth the 1.5+ hour wait. I would recommend this dish to people who like homemade Chinese dumplings because they are delicious, not because they are the watery relatives of potstickers. But if they don't come at the end of your meal, you should probably cancel the order.

All in all, it was a decent Chinese eatery with some management/service issues. I saw some items on the menu that I don't usually see elsewhere and they are quite good. But still, these are basic, entry-level Chinese food items that are quick to prepare and hard to mess up. I would probably come back and hope to see an improvement in the structureless service.",3,2012-10-08 17:37

It's a 30-45 min drive but it's worth it...when it's made RIGHT. It is worth the money too...but I think they must have lost one of their main chiefs or something because ever since they started training all these new people it became inconsistent every single time. The first time both our cauliflower tacos were so burnt it was stuck together and black...I was left confused why it was even served to us? I didn't even take one bite I was so upset and disappointed. They did take care of us afterwards..but it happened again..and then once again just the last time I ate here. I love this food so I refuse to give it a bad rating and I know it's not really their fault...it's who ever is cooking. And I'm also tired of them forgetting the pumpkin seeds!!

The food is simple and amazing! I personally love the eggplant with noodles and their pizzas which are stunning!

QdeHvvMuB5fGhUt3xtbuzA,WG4k5OMv5Kjp2aQK0DEtwQ,cPEo3-TmIqCwHLFGKZgwGg,"So where to begin. It's a small place that's your typical hole in the wall setting, but clean. Pictures hung on the walls provides some ideas of what the dishes look like. Those of you that are used to Panda Express, PF Chang, or your typical American Chinese food or whatever New York Chinese food are, you won't find anything familiar. This is a place that specializes in northern Chinese food. This means noodles, dumplings, buns, and lots of wheat based products. The place should get an extra star for not having beef and broccoli on their menu. I mean seriously there is no broccoli in China until the recent decade. Beef and broccoli IS NOT Chinese food! The menu certainly brings back childhood memories. This is authentic northern China home cooking people! I do see some Sichuan dishes and I'm curious to try. 

Went with couple co-workers for lunch to check the place out. I ordered the dumplings and the meat pie. The woman that owns the place was extremely nice. The service was above average. She brought out the corn based congee, which I'm assuming comes free with the meal. It's pretty much flavorless but easily fixed by putting in some soy sauce. I'm assuming that's how they are served authentically. The dumplings are ok and could used some additional seasoning. But they aren't super doughy like other Chinese places. I liked the meat pie. It was hot, juicy, and yummy. I can certainly say it was filling and I was stuffed. I'm definitely going back and try out some of the stirfry dishes. Haven't had those for eons and I really hope they live up to expectation. When it comes down to it, it's home cooking. You aren't going to find it superbly amazing like a 4 star restaurant and this is no Imperial cooking, but they are hearty and filling at a decent price. Until I try their other dishes, they'll get 4 stars because the memories made me happy, the service was good, and the food wasn't half bad. :) I really hope they would maybe offer the pork and veggie bao. That would just put it over the top.",4,2011-08-25 0:12

Granted I did not give the Cactus Rd. buffet a shot thanks to Yelp Reviews, I did want to see what Marigold Maison was about. Great ambiance and open kitchen, Sunil the head chef is always welcoming. Andy was a great host that kept our kids thoroughly entertained the entire evening. My kids now say let's go eat at ""Andy's Place"", not a name change suggestion just pointing out the impression he made. And as parents know entertaining the kids while out to eat can be a challenge. Lentil cakes and my standard chicken tikka masala were our choice that evening and they were as good as ever. I would recommend trying it out and will go again to see if they can edge up to 5 stars like the Bombay Spice of yore...

A side note, as I was leaving the restaurant, a couple mentioned to Andy how their ""dinner was good but they miss the buffet"". Andy pointed out that reviews for the buffet were not favorable on Yelp, at which point the couple proceeded to say Yelp reviews are a fraud, bla bla bla...I couldn't bare listening to it and felt like I needed to stand up for Yelp as someone that really finds value from it. It's no fraud! You can quickly figure out which reviews are ""fraudulent"" and which are not, so I'm glad to see Bombay/Marigold Maison is in touch with reality and Yelp's value add to restaurant owners.

To my surprise it's only about 2 blocks away from where I work too!  The seating kinda sucks, especially if you have more than two people.  I was with a group of four and instead of having bar top style seating where everyone is facing the conveyer belt so that they can grab their own stuff, they have actual tables where only two of the four seats are next to the conveyer.  Therefore the people on the outside have to either reach in front of the other people or constantly be asking for stuff to be grabbed for them.  Not ideal.

The sushi itself I would put at average at best.  Everything had a general temperature of lukewarm whether it was something that should have been cold or hot, one of the downfalls of this system I guess.  I will say the cream puffs were delicious though, but really who goes to a sushi place for cream puffs?  The service wasn't great either and I mean I guess that's another flaw in this kind of system, your food comes on the constantly moving belt but trying to get your drinks refilled or get the check was a little bit of a hassle.  Basically I think this is a cool place to come for the experience but this is not a place I would go to when I want some good sushi.",3,2013-08-15 19:04

The fact that you can go to a restaurant and not ask your server if what you order is vegetarian friendly is a dream come true!  I go to Green when I am craving vegetarian comfort food.  The spicy buffalo wings and vegan chili fries are a good way to kick that craving.   The no harm chicken parm sandwich is so tasty but watch out it is messy!

It's a good place to grab a drink and some chips & guac, but not really great as a dining destination. The menu is small and there is all of one vegetarian entree choice. I ordered the veggie street tacos, and they were fine. Nothing really spectacular but not terrible either. The size of one order of tacos ($7) is too small to make a lunch, so you will need to order chips & salsa ($6) and/or chips & guacamole ($6). The salsas are just okay - we got the trio to try them all and the pico and tomatillo were a little bland. The chipotle roasted was yummy. The negative with our $6 order is that each salsa comes in a tiny little dish and though you get free refills, our service wasn't fantastic and it took a good amount of time. The guacamole is good. For being such a fancy place, it's so strange that when you order water it's the really nasty Phoenix hard-metal tasting water. Someone forgot to install a filter.

I would return here for happy hour to have a drink and some chips out on the patio, but don't plan on having entire meals here.",3,2013-06-24 18:44

As for the food, I enjoy the fish tacos, as well as the baja lobster tacos.  Absolutely delicious!  I always tell myself I'm just getting 2 tacos, but end up getting 3 or sometimes, even four!  The guacamole is pretty good here as well. It always seems to sneak its way on our table as well.  

As for the service:  My fiance and I come here a lot, so we've had our share of good and bad servers.  Some are very friendly and are more than happy to please you, however, we've had a server or two who never checks up on you and takes 20 minutes to bring a beer even when its not busy.  Service is kind of hit-or-miss, but the food definitely makes up for it, and the prices are more than fair.

grazie was famous for its wood fired pizza with fresh dough and great flavors.

I cannot believe it has taken me this long to come here but this was one of the best dining experiences I have had in a long time. If you don't know, Café Monarch is a family owned and operated upscale dining establishment nestled in an unassuming Scottsdale neighborhood.  The restaurant itself has a very homey, intimate feel. We were lucky enough to get a table for two outside and the weather was incredible. The décor was simple and beautiful; you really did feel like you were in a secret garden.

The prix fixe menu changes constantly so you never know what you're going to get. For my first course I had the roasted cauliflower soup with truffle oil and pine nuts adding a delicate balance of flavor. Second course was a spring salad with compressed watermelon. Simple and beautifully presented. The third course was the lollipop lamb chop that was cooked perfectly medium rare and melted in your mouth. I opted for the cast iron filet mignon served with caramelized shallot butternut squash pave, crispy Brussel sprouts, with a beef jus emulsion. This was definitely one of the most memorable steaks I have ever had. Not only was the presentation on point but it was perfectly seared and tender. 

As far as I know, Café Monarch is the only restaurant in Arizona whose servers are all trained sommeliers as well. This adds an excellent element of service to the entire dining experience as the wine paring is perfect. Our servers and their assistants were all so attentive without being overbearing.

Stopped by for football and beer... $3.00 Dos drafts all day, every day. Can't beat that!

I was totally being friendly and honestly wouldn't have cared if I had to pay a couple extra dollars but the waitress was snotty and rudely explained that it was a busy weekend and ""you know, we raise prices when we're busy. Really!? 

Having managed restaurants myself, I get that, but you're seriously going to TELL customers that? She then explained ""it's in the computer that way and you can talk to the Manager if you want"". 

Again, arguing over a couple dollars is not my style but after being talked to like I was an annoying cheapskate, I said yes, please, send the Manager over. 

The Manager came over and explained that sometimes their vendors put up posters and they weren't aware of it but that he would have them taken down.

The restaurant is super tiny! But very cute, I love the patio area too. The bar area and decor is neat and I really liked that aspect of 32 Shea. There were some bugs flying around inside which was gross but the doors were open, not anyone's fault or anything ha.
We were seated pretty quickly. Our server informed us that it was his first night serving, and I totally wouldn't have known if he didn't say anything, because he did an excellent job! 
The menu looked to have some good options on it. The bruschetta caught my eye because there were so many kinds, and they're $3 each which I think is pretty reasonable because they are big. I ordered 3 and it was a good amount. I got one with tomato,
mozzarella, and basil, one with Brie, apples, and honey, and one with Gorgonzola with figs. Generally they were pretty good but not great, I thought there was too much bread. My favorite was the tomato mozzarella basil one. Though the middle of the bread was completely soggy with balsamic. The Gorgonzola fig one was my least favorite, too much cheese and not enough figs, the cheese was too strong to have so much on there. The brie apple honey one was in the middle, there wasn't enough Brie, but it was pretty good and I liked it. My sister got turkey burger sliders and she did not like them very much, said they made her feel sick. We also got spinach and artichoke dip which we all liked! My mom liked her salmon salad as well.

Tom's Thumb gave me the convenience of being able to fill up my tank, get my car washed and grab some delicious lunch in under an hour.

One little thing though that's offputting is how they include the price of the game with any items your server brings out such as food and drinks as one bill, that percentage-wise, makes it seem that you need to tip more at the end. I mean, if it costs $35 to hit balls for an hour, and you order one $5 beer, you now owe more for the tip on that beer than the beer itself.  It seems like trickery to get the servers bigger tips.

Now where do i start on my new review... I struggled between 2 or 3 stars, but i am being biased and letting them live with the 3 instead.

I haven't been to 32 in 2 weeks, and decided to stop by and get some drinks with my wife. When we get there it is all new people working there, that is a little depressing. I will reminisce that the first baristas i met here have been hands down my favorite and none have filled the shoes they left.

Back to my experience.. I have my loyalty card with one punch left. That means my wife and I only need to pay for one of our drinks! Yay! Sounds like my day is going pretty well. The next event was waiting for this girl who was just tinkering on the Ipad to get done and greet us and get our orders. We order or drinks, 

and she says ""I can't give you your free drink.""

I was just honestly confused and stunned so i didn't say anything.

girl-""You are doing this in one purchase right?

me-""yes...."" at this point in my head i am thinking...WHAT!?!? it has NEVER been like that..for the 3 or so years i have been coming here it has NEVER been like that...

girl-""well you can do it in two transactions""

me- ""yeah do that."" ... at this point to prevent me from being over involved in this conversation i flip open my phone and wait for her to figure this all out

The girl turns to the person working on the bar and asks some question about the situation. YAY it's the manager working at the bar, finally a familiar face. She was as confused as i was about the situation.

girl- ""well i don't want to give them a double discount, a punch in the card and a free drink""


At this point i just space out because this is the most ridiculousness i have heard. NO WHERE does that,  or acts like that...let alone in front of a customer. Granted i did not say anything else and just got my drink and left.

The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, the selection at the deli and small grocery section is ample, the service is with a smile.

Here are a few more reasons you should go here:

~Large selection of dried pastas, imported food from Europe, and a selection of canned San Marzano tomatoes.
~Make a quick stop on the way home to pick up a tasty bakery treat and a cappuccino.
~Call ahead and order a pizza for takeout or calzone to fill your belly.
~Stop at the deli and pick up some fresh sliced Boar's Head meats & cheeses or some freshly made antipasti, green salad or even ravioli.

You can even take a moment and eat in the restaurant or on the patio. As others have mentioned here, there're many wonderful things on the menu, but I will have to agree that the Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich is absolutely wonderful and perhaps one of the best you will find; as is the Sausage Sandwich and Meatball.

I took the girlfriend here to try something new. The experience was cool but I didn't particularly get enthused by the food. It wasn't bad... it just wasn't to my liking. With that said, the GF liked it. We ordered the bruschetta which was totally different. You actually pick 4 flavors out of 6 flavors - mix and match how you like. The flavors were not what I was expecting. We got the  Pistachio, Date and Marscarpone; House Made Ricotta, Heirloom Tomatoes and Basil Vinaigrette; Tenderbelly Bacon Jam and Whipped Goat Cheese; and the Prosciutto, House Made Ricotta and Fig Honey. The prosciutto was by far the most ""normal"" of the bunch in my opinion. The tenderbelly bacon jam one was interesting - like a smoky, meat, jelly concoction that really didn't make sense to my tastebuds but was still good. The pistachio one felt like I was eating a gooey trailmix blend on a piece of bread. Again, not bad but just not my style. Maybe someone who likes the finer things in life would enjoy them more than I did. Your mileage may vary and I think I would have enjoyed the bowl of olives more.

I ordered the brazilian steak and the GF ordered the watermelon salad. For mine the brazilian steak was, again, different. It was more like a raw beef hamburger than a steak. Very flavorful but I could have used it less juicy/messy than it was. Still good. I'd get it again. The GF loved her salad.

In general I kind of want to give it a 3 star review. It just wans't anything that wowed me. However, I feel like I walked into someplace that I knew was different and I got what I thought I was going to get... something different. I can't knock a place for doing what they do any more than I can knock McDonalds for not being a 5-star restaurant. For what it aims to be I think it does a very good job at.

They were packed for lunch, and while we were seated fairly quickly, the wait staff was a little slow in getting us drinks and grabbing our order.  Probably not a place to grab a 'quick' lunch, but with how busy they were, it was forgivable.  Their menu has a number of vegetarian and gluten free items, and everything is freshly made.  I opted for their 'Perfectly Grilled Cheese', and it was a great spin on a classic grilled cheese.

They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. Have soda's, Italian soda's, coffee, tea, beer, wine and hard liquor. It's small inside with about 6 tables and a bar with seats around it as well. Cute dog friendly patio with umbrellas outside.
Multiple Veggie options available! I had the Veggie-Tarian sandwich and it was great. Seems like they have varied menu options and special dishes that change from day to day. The ingredients were fresh and quality. 
32 has done amazingly with a concept that is very difficult for restaurants... To excel at ALL 3 meals, keep up variety, have a spectacular coffee bar, innovative menu, and now have a full bar as well. 
There is even a drive through window! 
I felt right at home and cannot wait to come back for some wine. The wine list looked extensive and varied. 
Keep supporting local and get here! It's amazing. I kind of want to live in a little loft above it.",5,2011-06-29 20:15

We had reservations for an early dinner (5:30pm) and we were seated as soon as we arrived. We decided to splurge on a bottle of wine and selected the Char Sui Pork Belly Steamed Buns as an appetizer. They were very good and the only complaint we had was the sauce served on them was inconsistent in its quantity. The first had very little (too sparse) while the middle one seemed perfect and then the third one seemed to have just a tad too much so it was a bit overpowering. But the pork belly was cooked perfectly and had a very nice crispiness on the outside of it. Our entrees arrived and I opted for the Classic Four (Hibachi Grilled Salmon, Misoyaki Butterfish, Blackened Ahi Tuna, and Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi). They were all fabulous with my favorites being the Butterfish and the Salmon and my least favorite the Mahi Mahi - which totally surprised me as I was expecting it to be my favorite. It just seemed to lack the flavor the others had and seemed a little too mushy. Hubby ordered the Shellfish Sampler which consisted of Lobster Tail, Seared Sea Scallops, Teppanyaki Shrimp, and Asparagus. His also came with a Lobster Red Curry Sauce and Creamy Jasmine Rice. He loved his as well and although a couple of the shrimps seemed to be a tad over cooked, they were still delicious! We also got sides of the Asparagus with Beurre Blanc and the Lump Crab Fried Rice. The Asparagus was amazing and cooked perfectly! Hubby couldn't quit raving about them! The Fried Rice was okay but nothing spectacular honestly. Service was great and our waitress was very attentive and brought us a free Chocolate Molten Lava Soufflé with ice cream for our anniversary. Very much appreciated and ooey, gooey deliciousness!

I'm a fan of the H3 roll which is spicy tuna, spicy salmon and spicy yellowtail, and the Ahi Tower too which is more a rice bowl of sorts. What I love about this place is that it's unique in that their sushi is made with purple or forbidden rice. So it's better than white rice, and brown rice too.

Chris Bianco had his first wood fired oven in Town and Country on 20th st and Camelback. He was young and passionate and his pizza was sublime. I never really understood his move downtown but it worked out for him, at least in the fame department. We found it too difficult to be loyal followers at the Adams location with the long waits and lousy parking. The pizza was excellent, but the hype about it being ""the best"" was a distraction, and like all such titles is debatable and temporary.
The operation has expanded to 2 eateries and returned to almost the same spot in Town and Country and   we think it's darned good. The service is attentive and the menu is appealing.

c_W3ViQhemuAbBL-py74aQ,_DUJDQf6fnNAUqWUGqrjwg,AMN3Sgns9tB2x-b3eWk0qQ,"Last Saturday my boyfriend and I discovered the Noodles Ranch (that's what she said!) The Noodles Ranch is located on the Southeast corner of Thomas and Scottsdale Road in the Albertson's shopping center. From the outside it looks much like any other strip mall - hole - in -the -wall restaurant but from he inside it's quite apparent that this restaurant has a lot more character than most. 

The decor is what you would expect from a Vietnamese restaurant but with a more modern and upscale twist. The music that was playing while we dined was extremely relaxing and made the experience that much more pleasant. I was even really impressed with the presentation of the food and the dishware. I love the dishes that look (even if they aren't) hand glazed with deep rich blue hues (with all their bubbly imperfections). 

The food itself was extremely satisfying as well. Both my boyfriend and I shared an egg roll appetizer (we debated between this and the spring rolls which also sounded quite tempting). The egg rolls came with fresh lettuce (to wrap them in) along with freshly chopped carrots, cucumbers, sprouts, a special sauce with a bit of a tang to it. For the main course we both ordered a bowl of the chicken Pho with broccoli and bok choy. Pure deliciousness. I'm a huge fan of Pho and often go to Saigon Nites up in Scottsdale with my coworkers every couple weeks but I thought Noodles Ranch offered a product that was far superior (especially with the slight twist to such a traditional plate with the addition of bok choy and broccoli). The appetizer wasn't much more than $5.95 and the bowls of soup themselves were about $7-8. An overall very good value for all the food you get. The bowls of Pho were HUGE but I did notice on the menu that you can add more noodles (the restaurant namesake) for $1.00. 

I was also feeling a bit under the weather that day and I think Pho was just what I needed to clear out the sinuses. Nothing a bit of chili paste, hoisin sauce, and some steeping jalapeno peppers can't cure! 

I will definitely be keeping this place in mind next time I'm in the mood for a quick bite of asian cuisine, and it's so close to my house!",4,2009-03-03 21:34

TAdJHijfPUf9225PMkU_-Q,6k2VpCFOJrXoqcEevwGgxA,fnaDx7UD4MiodQlgYHDwsQ,"Wow - a lot of 5 star reviews on the Dragon Palace.  I suspect many are giving heavy handed reviews as this is a ""sentimental"" favorite.  I guess even my rating is slightly biased that way too.  But 5 stars people?  Meaning it cannot get any better than ""woohoo, as good as it gets""?  Ok, I'll end my rant and get to the review.

In short, this is your typical old school Mandarin/Szechuan style chinese restaurant.  Decor is slightly tired, but who really cares about decor anyways for a neighborhood chinese restaurant?

Staff couldn't have been friendlier.  It's family run (from what I gather) and take out service is quick and efficient.  They include almond cookies, sauces, utensils, and fortune cookies in a nice packet with your to go order.  Everything was packaged VERY well.

The menu is a diverse variety of your typical chinese items.  Be aware that some dishes (like the Moo Goo Gai Pan) have alternate names (like ""Snow White Chicken"").

Still with me?  Good...on to the food.

I ordered BBQ pork slices, Kung Pao Chicken, and a dish they called ""Bo Bo Shrimp"".  

The BBQ pork slices were generally not too fatty as they can be other places, however some pieces were sliced too thin as they were dry.  Also, the seasoning did not permeate the meat that much.  There was also no ""sauce"" (which is good, because Char Siu should not have any sauce per se).  Maybe I'm just spoiled with good BBQ pork, and I also realize it's just an appetizer, but could have been better and more flavorful.

The Kung Pao Chicken is very average.  First I'm appreciative of chinese restaurants that use dark meat instead of white as it's not dry.  But add to that a lot of peanuts that were a little overpowering (I felt like an elephant), lots of cubed green pepper and onion, and a lot of sauce made this the typical Kung Pao chicken.  Was it bad?  It wasn't bad, but not 5 stars great either.  I don't know if I really understand why Phoenix area chinese places are compelled to throw a ton of vegetables in Kung Pao.  It'd be nice for once to have a relatively vegetable-less ""meat"" dish and order vegetables separately (like how you order at better chinese places).  Compared to other places in Phoenix, it was probably better than what I've had, but again, not 5 stars ""amazing"".

The Bo Bo shrimp was a breaded shrimp dish with a spicy brown sauce.  On the positive, I tasted the ginger and garlic come out of the sauce, but the breading on the shrimp was so heavy it was falling off as I ate it.  Perhaps it was because it was take out and it got soggy, so I'll reserve some judgement for when I dine in person, but I've had plenty of take out and the shrimp are not always like that.  I would have preferred a lighter coating which can be achieved with a dusting of cornstarch.

I can see why this place has gotten the accolades because relatively speaking, there isn't a lot of good accessible chinese food here in Phoenix (well, unless you go to Cofco Plaza, Lee Lee Market, Great Wall, etc.).  But again, there is much better around.

With that being said, if you've read my other reviews you'll see I am a big fan of locally run non-chain restaurants.  So don't let my review scare you too much, I'm just picky and have high expectations.  I certainly could have ordered items that are difficult to make poorly (Mushu pork, mongolian beef, etc.) but chose Kung Pao as it's difficult to pull off properly.  So please try this place for yourself and form your own opinion.  At least you have mine.",3,2010-01-11 16:35

I describe this cuisine as Americanized Asian food.  I like that they offer an option of brown rice with all the meals, and you can substitute most of the meats for tofu if you like that.  The Evil Jungle Princess is my absolute favorite.  A sweet and spicy peanut sauce on top of chicken, mushrooms, onions, and crispy fresh green beens that are cooked just the right amount so they snap when you bite into them.  I also love the Wango Mango chicken with big chunks of mango.  Everyone always loves the New Wave Pad Thai.  The Teriyaki Salmon is cooked to perfection, on top of a bed of wasabi mashed potatoes and green beens.  The Firecracker chicken tastes like wing sauce, so if you like wing sauce you will like this.  Otherwise you might want to pass.  The best part of this restaurant is the kids meals.  They serve them in a Bento Box, with little square compartments for each portion of the meal.  It's a great value that comes with a main dish of either noodles and chicken or wonton chicken, and edamame, and fried wontons with sweet and sour sauce, and a whole large bag of M&Ms, that the waiter was smart enough to secretly hand me on the side instead of serving it up with the rest of the meal.",5,2010-03-15 23:26

They have nice wine selection. They have options to pair with each dish but we chose to order a bottle instead. Unfortunately a bottle my date chose didn't quite work out. We both had a feeling it will take time but what we underestimated was how long it took before it became good. They transferred wine into decanter, but it took a long time for wine to become good. Around the time the main dish came, our wine started to taste where this wine should taste. They do have nice crystal wine glasses though..  

They serve four course menu here. They had two options for the soup.  Soup was a bit too salty, we both didn't finish. Salad was very good, I especially enjoyed brussels sprouts. Flavor and texture was just right, I would have enjoyed larger portion of the salad. Nice presentation too with different colors.

Main dish was nicely done. I enjoyed my fish and his steak. Around this time, my wine tasted really good with oaky smell to it. When he looked at the menu, he knew I was going to order fish for my main dish so he chose this wine. It just took a long time.

Desert and service was just average. I enjoyed the ambiance more than anything.",4,2016-01-31 11:56

What I would have liked to see was something a little more flavorful that seems like a chef made it, rather than it feeling like something I could have made.

Service: the service was adequate. However at a nice restaurant such as this I have the tendency to expect above average service, seeing as they generally get an above average tip since the food is pricy.

Location: I think the ambiance is what people love so much about this place. It is underground and gives you the sense that you are on a boat. The lighting is dimmed so low that at times it can be hard to see the menu. I used the flash light on my phone to view the menu.",3,2015-10-24 20:09

Quite pleasantly surprised to discover this airy, spacious resto-lounge in Scottsdale Fashion Sq. Stopped in during happy hr. on a Thursday, decent mix of patrons. Overall space is versatile and occasion-friendly, great alfresco feel as giant oak doors were opened to the outdoor patio.  Lounge is perfect for small parties with low couches and leather sofa chair seating.  Great happy hr. specials (M-F 4-6pm) $5 small plates, well drinks, house wine, sangria. 

Prosciutto bruschetta w/crescenza cheese, arugula & fig preserves was perfectly balanced. Italian sausage flatbread w/pequillo peppers & goat cheese - the peppers and goat cheese made this flatbread, the sausage was overly crumbled and didn't add much flavor. The cheese plate was fine - a mild blue and a mild Spanish cheese, plated with thinly sliced apples, marinated in a fruit jam.

Apparently, they're serving a $20 3-course prix-fixe w/several interesting options through 10/31. Menu here: http://www.foxrc.com/downloads/menus/O&I_Prix_Fixe_Menu.pdf

Cons: White (pink) sangria was prettily presented sugar-rimmed, but served sans fruit (odd). Have had much better sangria. Service was spotty but potentially b/c bartender was doubling as our server, other servers ended up busing our table and were helpful.

The good
- fun, lively atmosphere. Funny signs, Christmas lights, classic rock. I felt like I was in Rocky Point.
- the host and busboy were very nice.
- good salsa but HOT. I mean I like my salsa spicy (I despise the tomatoey gringoish salsas served in chain restaurants) but this stuff made me have to go to the bathroom and blow my nose twice. More on the bathrooms later...
- my chili relleno plate was very good. The chili sauce was on top was delicious. I was scared it would be super hot but it was just hot enough. Beans and rice that accompanied it were just okay.
- my hubby liked his shrimp dish. 
- good price for a pitcher of Mexican beer.
- they leave you with a pitcher of water to cool down your mouth.

The bad
- our server sucked. He had a personality of a robot. He barely did any of the work either. He just took our order. The nice busboy seemed to do the rest.
- this place really nickel and dimes you. They charge you for a chips and salsa refill. And they only provide one free refill of soda. 
- prices are kind of high for how small the portions are. My plate had one small chili relleno and a small amount of rice and beans. My husband's plate was really tiny. Mexican food should not be this expensive!
- the bathrooms had NO toilet paper in either stall. And were really dirty.
- stomach issues afterwards. Maybe it was because of the spice level, I don't know. But it was an unpleasant night of sleep.",3,2011-04-23 18:05

Had I not have to wait 20 minutes for two sandwiches, I'd easily give this meal 4 stars.  Looking over these photos and remembering how good these sandwiches tasted, I'd like to visit again soon, but recalling how long my wait was, and the negative vibes that bounced off the cook (that took my order) and another whom I thought was either an owner or a manager, I am very hesitant on returning.  :(  I did enjoy the sandwiches, especially the cheesesteak, even though half-way through my half-sandwich, I decided it was a little too salty.  I thought the marinara on the parm a great contrast to the rich, creaminess of the cheesesteak and kept me reaching for another bite of the eggplant!  Loved munching on the hefty wheat roll, but I didn't care much for the soft white roll that the parm rested on.",3,2011-01-12 7:25

Chose this place based on Yelp reviews since we live an hour away and weren't familiar with the area. We decided to come at 5pm, in the middle of what I read was their happy hour. It was a Sunday and it certainly wasn't crowded. There were maybe 2 other tables when we were seated. 

It's a nice place. A little smaller than I expected from pictures on Yelp, but that's not a bad thing. My husband and I both got drinks. He got a beer and I got ""Ginger is a Peach"", which was good. 

We decided on the bruschetta board. Of the four we tried, our favorites were the tomato and the salmon. Our least favorite was the fig/pistachio one. It just tasted too much like a dessert. It was the only one neither of us volunteered to finish. 

My husband ordered the New York steak and I ordered the duck. We both really enjoyed our entrees. I guess word that it was my birthday got out, because out came a dessert...it was like a s'more in fudge form. I expected it to be warm, but the fudgey part was actually cool. Not sure if it was supposed to be or not. I'd seen pictures of other desserts on Yelp even though there was no dessert menu that I saw and I would have likes to try something else, but the s'more thing was pretty good. 

Overall, it was a good experience. Our server seemed a little over expectant...always looking at us like we were being too slow even though that wasn't the case, while at the same time stopping to chat with another table like old buddies.

fCqaPRZok2zbAIbaijSY6A,CkM9FtxelvahpE9StyON3A,PNTyiqS7R-0c1ofxOfDijQ,"Ever wondered what it's like to visit the Secret Garden? I imagine the atmosphere would sort of be like the patio at Cafe Monarch. Head past the intimate chef's kitchen dining room, which seats about 10, and through the gorgeous indoor restaurant that will make you feel like you're in a castle dining room, and walk out to the patio covered in candles, featuring a fountain, and ensconced with flowers. It's one of the most romantic restaurants in the Valley I've ever been to, and it re-opens Friday, October 4, after new ownership.

Every night, Cafe Monarch features a unique three-course prix fixe menu, based on seasonal items and Chef Andrew Nienke's taste. Call ahead if you have special dietary needs, and they'll adjust the menu accordingly for you.

I went there last week with some girlfriends -- thank you so much to new owner Christian Lewkowicz for the invitation -- and had one of the freshest meals I've ever had. We started with a watermelon salad, which came with huge chunks of juicy watermelon and a bed of fresh greens. I love watermelon salad, and this one was extra-tasty.

My pals had salmon and filets for their entrees, while I got to nibble on quinoa topped with fresh carrots and leeks. The portion size was huge and left me stuffed.

For dessert, we were treated to freshly baked puff pastries topped with fresh berries and vanilla ice cream. I slurped up every bite of the dessert, which was light and refreshing and managed to seem healthy because of the fruit. 

My favorite part of Cafe Monarch, though, was the atmosphere and hospitality. The service was amazing and made you feel like you were in your own little world -- perfect for an anniversary dinner or special get-together. Our meals would have cost $45 each, which was a steal for such unique culinary creations and such top-notch ingredients. The relaxed atmosphere will transport you out of the Valley for a night and make you feel like you're in your own private retreat.",5,2013-10-04 0:18
epoEydaACHnjCgqaF4li8g,Td4sUPBkcuKHxH3OH2bP2A,PxTKXsdYqoFHWAG2amz0XQ,"Sadly, as I am a huge Arcadia Nook fan, I cannot give this location the 5 star rating I was totally expecting to give.  I am in love with the Wood Fired Olives appetizer here, we ordered that and it was totally on par with the Arcadia location.  My family ordered two pizza's the Giardino and the Margherita and said it was also on par with Arcadia and they looked great.    

My order was the Cowboy Rib Eye.  I typically bounce back and forth between the Chicken Marsala and the Filet, and I tell everyone the Filet at Nook Arcadia is the best $27 filet you will ever eat.   They don't offer the Filet here so I went with their new Ribeye which is $34 and served over smashed Yukon Gold potatoes with four asparagus spears on the side.  

Presentation and plating was beautiful... My mouth was watering... The ribeye was bone-in BUT it was full of fat and gristle, it was edible but I spent most of the time trying to cut around the gristle or pulling it out of my mouth. I don't mind fat in my steak I just prefer more to steak to fat, and not the tough gristle this steak had throughout.  The potatoes which were advertised as garlic parmesan were also bland and seem to be lack both garlic and parmesan. The asparagus was good.  This is not anything like the preparation or quality of the Filet at Arcadia and it was a 2 star dish for me for sure on the steak quality alone. I typically want to lick my plate at Nook but this wasn't the case the plate left the table with half a steak, lots of fat pieces and almost all the potatoes.  

This location charges more for the same dishes, understandably they are in the hotel, it is bigger and they likely have more expenses, however I was a little surprised to see the same Chicken Marsala offered at Arcadia was $5 more here.  

The valet parking is also expensive, $17 normally, $12 if you eat at the restaurant and get a stamp.  Find a parking spot if you can and don't valet, this isn't Nook's fault, just a tip.

If it weren't for the olives and pizza this would sadly be a 2 star review for me. Service was good.",3,2016-06-23 0:03

It's not your typical gyro you would get at a Greek place. It's beef, not lamb, includes a pickle (kind of weird at first but I embrace it now), and not nearly as greasy/messy. It's a much healthier version (I think). 

I didn't know they had a restaurant location and boy was it a pleasant surprise! The menu at the restaurant is a lot larger than what they offer at the mall. I have had multiple things on the menu. My go-tos are the gyro, roasted chicken pita, and the greek salad (which is huge). All of them are delicious and I could come here again and again. Oh, the hummus is good too but you'll want to order extra tomatoes or cucumbers (for a charge) because they never give you enough. However, with so many great places to try in the area, I'm trying to dine at a new place every time I eat out so I haven't been back in a long time. This might need to change though.

This time, they still had disposable drink cups but I was very happy to see they were now a light plastic. I was soooo happy!

I got an egg sandwich, minus the ham and on a enflish muffin rather than sourdough bread. It was fantastic! Like a dream in my mouth. Cooked to perfection! I could've easily shared this with another diner, which was my first thought, but after one bite I just couldn't stop. Loved it.

My only one criticism is the employee who greeted us and took our order wasn't very warm or welcoming. She cut me off like 3 times and repeated things in a very annoyed tone. Hey, it's not my fault you are hung over and work at a breakfast place.

The food is very good and the service is hit or miss but what impressed me most is the wide selection of Vegetarian dishes.  I am not vegetarian but some of my friends are and sometimes I just feel like eating something lighter.  They have a great selection of grilled veggie filled burritos.  You can also get sides of grilled veggies like asparagus, zucchini and carrots.  Be sure to try the grilled carrots.

If you're looking for an urban escape into the farming community of Phoenix past, then be sure to stop in for a visit.  I've always heard good things about Morning Glory café here at the farm at south mountain for brunch on the weekends, we had a visitor in town, wanted food, was looking for an experience we've never had, one plus one equals two, so we ended up at the farm!

I'm so glad we chose to dine at morning glory, the entire place is super cool. Lined in an old pecan grove, there are a handful of shops to check out, some artist studios, two or three places to eat, and the grounds are a great place to take in also. This was the perfect stop for brunch before we headed up to the top of south mountain to check out the views. For anyone in the market, this is also a wedding venue, it's a venue like none other in Phoenix - if you're looking for that. :-)

A huge plus is that they let you sample their food. So you basically get to taste the whole menu before you even order, which was fantastic! They make you feel like a valued customer. And they'll help you order and explain everything if you're a newbie.

My favorites were the jade red chicken and the jerk chicken. I could eat the jade red chicken all day, yeah it's that good! It has the right amount of sweet and sour without just being drenched in some indescribable sauce. The jerk chicken was good but it was too peppery like I was forewarned.

We ordered 3 different types of naan, and they forgot the garlic and gave us aloo instead. They made it right, by bringing the garlic, but it took a while.

I ordered the *House Salad* and it wasn't as fresh as it typically is.

I also ordered the *Vegetable Biryani* rice with no peas, when it came, there were peas. I told the waiter and he apologized, and said we should keep that one and they would make another one. Then he came back a few seconds later and said, actually I need to take that one. I was obviously very concerned at this point that they were going to pick out the peas from my dish. The dish came back a few minutes later, luke warm, with a rogue pea or two.

I've been here on dates with my husband, double dates, and even small groups, and I've never had a bad meal.  Service, food quality, and atmosphere are all consistently solid!

I typically go for some red wine with my meals at PB, but they have a cocktail menu also.  

I recommend going here and eating family style.  Depending on the seasonal menu, start with a salad (I like the Simple Greens), and a few sides (ie: olives, vegetables and/or sausage).  Make sure you also get the fresh Bianco bread with olive oil!

From there, go for some pizza... We like the traditional Margherita and the Sonny Boy, but I don't think you can go wrong!

Lastly, try an entree or pasta or both... it's all good, I swear!  And if you have room, end with some of their homemade dessert!

This particular establishment has the same food quality and service but's freezing inside!! My food got cold right away because the fans are on so high the cold air blows your napkin around.  And it doesn't matter where you sit.  The place in an ice cube.  I asked the bartender and a hostess if there was anyway to lower the fans and vents but it was no help.  
The draft beer is ice cold and served in chilled mugs which would have been nice to enjoy if I didn't feel like i was sitting in a cooler.  We live in always sunny Phoenix but that day was about 67 degrees outside and inside felt about the same. I looked around at other customers and I could tell they were cold as well.  Later we went to visit with some friends and they told me that this Roadhouse is always freezing inside and to that they bring a hoodie when they go there.  I'm not kidding! 
So the food was great even though it cold before I could finish it and the service was nice but I doubt I will go back to this restaurant unless I'm wearing proper cold weather clothes.

We ordered the seared eggplant and butter shrimp as appetizers and they were both incredible. The seared eggplant was like candy it was so good and melt in your mouth! The butter shrimp was succulent accompanied by its chipotle cream sauce.

As entree, we ordered the spicy chicken korma and it was delightful. Our server Abraham brought us three different kinds of chutneys which were a nice finishing touch.

The service was spot on and very attentive. Thank you Abraham and the chefs who prepared this most delicious memorable meal ! Will definitely go back!",5,2016-10-27 3:05

There is no rhyme or reason to entering this place and figuring out where you're supposed to go and where you're supposed to order.   I'm sure it would be fine for just a coffee or beer, but I highly discourage ordering food.

I4knuF5ogTCcXh6yriH4wg,d_TBs6J3twMy9GChqUEXkg,PNTyiqS7R-0c1ofxOfDijQ,"Update: Chef Chris is awesome. He not only sent me a message late last night, but he called me this morning to personally apologize, talk with me about the experience, and insist I take a refund (which I did not want to take because there were a lot of positives about the experience that I thought were valuable). He really made me feel good about our experience and it is so rare for a person to be so mindful of his consumer and take the time to personally talk for ten minutes to make the situation right. That is very cool and makes me want to give this place another shot. 

Review: I was trying to decide between two and three stars because we went here for our fancy anniversary dinner and I really REALLY wanted to love this place! Unfortunately, it was disappointing. I'll start with the positive stuff, because there were lots of positives- 1. Chef Chris was super nice and friendly 2. I love the environment, we sat on the patio and it was beautiful. The tables were candlelit, there was a pretty fountain, and I LOVED the little wood burning fireplaces and the nice smell that the wood gave off 3. A lot of the food was good. We started with a very tasty minestrone soup with home made crackers and the dessert (pumpkin cheesecake) was also wonderful! I also liked that they put mint in the water and the coffee was very good.

 So now on to the not so great parts... So first, we had tried to go to this restaurant for my birthday in April, but a couple days before our reservation, the BF got a call saying that chef Chris had fallen ill and that we would not be able to have dinner there BUT that they would call us as soon as he came back to give us a reservation then. Well, I waited a month after my birthday... no birthday dinner.... cuz all I wanted was to go here. No call. The BF called and left several messages with no response. Then the message changed and they were closed for the summer and we went somewhere else. That was pretty bad. So now we got a res for our anniversary, and I was super excited but things went so wrong. The main dish was not at all impressive. I was told that one entree was chicken in a creamy sauce with black rice and spinach and I ordered that. The BF got a beef tenderloin with pesto, potato, and spinach. Well... they came out and my chicken and his steak were identical...both with pesto, spinach, grilled potato. That irked me a little bit, but I just figured that it was an honest mistake on the waiter's part. Then I took a bite of chicken and it had a gelatinous texture... I have never experienced that before, but I thought maybe it was just so juicy and I have never had chicken prepared in the same way before...Wrong. Then I took another bite and the texture was just weird. I tried to see if it was pink inside, but we only had the candlelight so I couldn't tell. Had the BF try it, and he said he thought it was underdone. Not a real awesome thing for chicken. So I sent it back and the waitress was very nice, apologized and took it. Chef Chris brought the new one out a few minutes later and was very sweet about it, which I appreciated. However, the chicken was not so awesome. Maybe I was just turned off to it or something... but it wasn't very appetizing. Anyway, it was kind of bland and the sides were not great... plain potatoes and raw spinach and tomato.... nothing special, and definitely nothing worth the price. The BF's steak was chewy but still better than the chicken, but essentially they tasted the same. The worst part, though, was unfortunately the service. I would understand the service being lackluster if chef Chris were doing it all himself, but with two people on waitstaff and only about 15 tables it was unacceptable. We were there for 2.5 hours, which would be fine if that was the intent of the restaurant..but I don't think it was. The first two courses were timely, but dessert was kind of a mess. We got some coffee...cute LARGE coffee cups, but not too much coffee in them and it wasn't hot, but it was tasty. We finished the coffee before we got our dessert. The waiter told us he'd bring some more coffee (us and the people next to us too) he came back a minimum of 3 times without refilling our coffee, probably more. I don't know if it was because there was a big table inside to tend to, but we did not get coffee until about 10 minutes after we finished our dessert and I had eaten slowly on purpose because I wanted to have coffee with dessert. THEN we proceeded to get the wrong check twice (with about ten minutes in between wrong checks) and wait about 35 minutes to get the correct check. There was some confusion between the waiter and waitress on who was supposed to take care of us, but it was a bit ridiculous. For 100$ for two people there are many places that have attentive service and tastier food. So for all of these reasons, I do not foresee us returning to this restaurant in the near future, unfortunately, because there really are some great aspects of this place",4,2011-10-30 5:15

The staff was incredibly attentive and kind. They were constantly refilling our dishes and water.

My only complaint is the same as one of my likes!  The food can be too hot!  There are not options to get the food a bit less hot (spicy!), so you have to be prepared for the spicy hot - but the flavor is well worth it!  I recently had the posole which was fantastic - and it is one of the few places outside of New Mexico where you can finish a meal off with Sopapillas (always a treat!).

We were seated at a large table inside that overlooked the patio the fountains and the ""waterfront"" (i say ""waterfront"" because it's actually a canal, and it seems so silly to refer to it as the ""waterfront""). The weather was beautiful, so all of the sliders were open, and the view was actually really nice. 

We started out by ordering two bottles of the Russian Jack Pinot Noir. It was the perfect choice with our dinner- light but flavorful. I'd definitely order it again. We also ordered two flatbreads, the sweet corn & tomato and the asparagus & wild mushroom. If you really twisted my arm, I might say that the corn & tomato was my favorite. But they were both so delicious, that it really is a tough decision. Before bringing our entrees, our waitress brought out the focaccia bread with pesto dipping sauce. I had to really try and restrain myself from eating all of it, so I would still have room for dinner, but it was hard because that stuff is delicious! 

When my meal arrived, I was slightly disappointed by how small it looked. I thought that maybe I should have loaded up on the focaccia while I still had the chance. I had ordered the Sweet Potato Cannelloni, and after the waitresses ravings, was really hoping for something a little larger. But when I took my first bite, everything changed. The sauce was so rich, and the only thing I can think to compare it to was cake. Each little bite of cannelloni was taking a bite of the best cake I've ever had. It was so sweet, but not overly sweet. And with little pearl onions and brussel sprout leaves scattered throughout, I was seriously in Heaven. I devoured my meal, even though I felt full about half way through, I just couldn't stop. 

The ambiance and service was great, but the food was amazing. It's definitely on the pricey side, but so worth the cost. I encourage everyone to stop in for a little bit of Heaven.",5,2010-03-19 16:34

The staff was very friendly, greeting us and guiding us through our first ordering experience. The menu is short, simple, bursting with flavor and very well planned out. Step 1: choose between 2 tacos, 2 enchiladas (or 1 each) on corn or flour tortillas made right in front of you or soup and salad.  I chose a smashed jack potato taco and a sautéed spinach mushroom enchilada, both on corn tortillas. Step 2: red or green sauce. The logical choice was red sauce over the enchilada and nothing over the smashed jack potato taco. Step 3: your choice of asadero or Chihuahua cheese. While, usually my answer to this question would be both, I opted to try only the lighter, asadero alone, so I could fully appreciate its flavor. At this point, my beautiful concoction was placed into an open oven, where I could see the white cheese melting into delicious, gooey goodness. Step 4: choose a salsa. Though they all sounded delicious, salsa verdes are always my first choice. Finally, you can pick chips and guacamole or salsa and your beverage. 

We paid and made our way to a table inside. Our food looked tasty and the presentation was nice, with the meals served in individual clay pots. My first bite of the spinach enchilada was exploding with the flavors in the red sauce, made with dry roasted red peppers. The mild jack and salsa verde rounded out the flavors without adding more heat. As incredible as my enchilada was, I have to say the taco was my favorite. The smashed jack potato filling plus the salsa verde was an even better flavor combination. I loved the texture of the potato and the chives were a great touch too. Morgan thoroughly enjoyed picks as well, a green chile pork enchilada with asadero cheese and green chile sauce (yeah, he really likes green chile) and a roasted tomatillo chicken enchilada with asadero and red sauce. The guacamole was a tasty side and a local brew completed my meal. I am thrilled that Gadzooks is in walking distance and I will definitely be back soon!",4,2013-04-11 20:02

Got there around 11:30 got the last parking spot in lot food in hand by 12:15 eating at home by 12:30. For those who aren't familiar with bbq pricing if you are not ordering a meal(meat sides drink etc) you pay by the pound. 

The prices here were very reasonable. Saturday Special is Beef Short Rib 18.99 a pound. I got a pound of that a pound of pulled pork 13.99 a pound  1 pork rib forget price and beef brisket 18.99 lb. On top of that the guy in front me ended up getting just the pork short rib meat so he let me have the bone to give to Charlie.(great bday present for the boy!) 

I know it was overkill but I don't know the next time i'll be able to go so I had to try it all. Next time I need to try the smoked turkey the sausage and the sides. 3 out of the items I loved. 1 liked. The pulled pork was good but not as flavorful as the others. The  in house bbq sauces made up for that. My favorite was the spicy so I bought a bottle $8 . The honey mustard one was good but too sweet to eat a lot of it. 

While waiting in line one of the employees was passing out water. There was misters while in line and a tent for shading a portion of the line as well. He saw me taking pictures of the smoker and walked up said sometimes they give tours of it but nothing to show today since they did all the cooking last night.

Our party ordered a couple bottles of well priced wines along with a bruschetta selection. I then went on to have a panini sandwich was was OK, nothing stunning but perfectly OK. If you have been to Postino in Arcadia you will recognize the menu immediately and thats a very good thing! Small plates with interesting ingredients is the order of the day here and I am personally thrilled that someone realized this concept would work down in the East Valley. Postino is my favorite restaurant in the Valley but sometimes you just don't want to schlep all the way up to Arcadia for a couple of glasses of wine and an appetizer. 

First impressions on a restaurant's opening weekend are always hard as you know they will improve as the weeks go by. There was a DJ on the night we were there that was intrusive to our conversation and added nothing to the evening (let's just hope that was a gimmick for the opening weekend). The wine selection was excellent but the food needed just a little tweaking. My sandwich was OK but could have been a lot better, not as crisp on the outside as you would normally like a  Panini. 

In the end I am very grateful to the owners of The Living Room for bringing this type of non-chain, wine-centric dining experience to Chandler where were are drowning in average restaurants. I will be back here for sure and will likely end up as a regular!",4,2010-01-13 15:32

To sum it up, it definitely lives up it's namesake of Arrogant. We were stuffed next to another couple in basically a doorway-so close you would think we were all together. That turned out to be ok as we chatted it up with them while waiting for service. I watched a waited scurry around and roll his eyes multiple times, and of course he turned out to be our waiter. He seemed very uninterested and didn't seem enthusiastic about...well anything really. The couple next to us said he was quite rude to them as well. We ordered a couple old fashions, which were delicious, but because the vibe was so unfriendly we decided to just get a charcuterie board and leave. The board took quite a while, but it was tasty. We got our check and went across the street for our dinner. We usually do eat at pricey places for date night, but the pretentious service just made it not worth it.",2,2015-08-21 22:52

As far as a breakfast/brunchery place, it'll probably hit the spot for most people. They have decent portions, decent prices and a vast selection of menu items. 

There is just a few things I would like to see homemade. Their corn beef hash is straight out of a can, their country gravy is straight out of a bag. If I remember correctly it's mixed with 3 qts. cold water, then added to 1 qt boiling water, and SHAZAAM! you have instant country gravy (I'd like to thank my first cooking job at Flying J for leaving that bit of knowledge in my head. )

Any way, the service is pretty good. We were there on a weekday, so business wasn't that bad. But I remember coming here on a Saturday years ago and the poor staff just got pummeled. 

So I give this place an average rating with food that will please most. They seem to be in business for quantity over quality.",3,2009-03-09 1:23

It gets really busy around noon, but if you take a later lunch, it's perfect. They play awesome music. I think it's geared to a younger crowd but good for anyone really. Definitely has the hipster touch, but it's not overwhelming. Food is suuuper yummy. I usually stick with the hot sandwiches. The BLT is TO. DIE. FOR. The North Beach is also very good.

Dumplings are handmade, which is a nice touch for sure.  You can't go wrong ordering these.  You won't get any sauce with it - just mix your own soy sauce with a touch of vinegar and spice.  I'll admit that I have had better dumpling elsewhere, but Chou's dumplings are pretty good for the Phoenix area.

Spicy beef and tendon dish (frequently recommended by other Yelpers) is good.  Could be spicer, but not bad.

I also ordered the meatball dish (known as Lion's head).  Nice flavor.  A little stingy on the number of meatballs though.

Service is slow, but then again, this can be expected from small mom and pop chinese restaurants.

Overall, this gets a 3.5 from me.  I'm not sure how it made Travel & Leisure's list, since it wasn't fantastic (though I've eaten at a few of the other restaurants on their list, and they can be hit-and-miss as well).  Still, a solid option.  Bump it up to 4-stars since I like to support local businesses.",4,2013-02-23 21:07

Can be crowded, at which point the level of service will go down...as with pretty much all awesome, affordable restaurants? Don't know why people would put ""crowded"" as such a downside. Other people want to eat here too. Call in your order, you goons.

Super casual atmosphere compared with a lot of Arcadia-area business lunch type places, but the food is absolutely top notch.

The quality of the meals here is almost unparalleled for the price. My favorites are mahi-mahi with pita chips, hummus trio with chicken, lentil fetoosh salad, and the lavosh shwarma wrap. I substitute veggies on some of these and they always get it right.

Also possibly the best iced tea in town. And they always give me a to-go cup.",4,2013-10-04 15:15

The tempura was light and fluffy with a fine mix of shrimp and veggies.   The dipping sauce was a bit on the bland side, but with the addition of soy sauce, it brought in the flavor.   I didn't try any of her nigiri, which is chef's choice.   She said it was good.  The sushi roll she didn't like.   I tried it as well.  I don't know what it was, but I would never order it.  It had some mixture of what appeared to be ""fake crab,"" which is a ground fish mixture and I don't know what else.  Ughhhh.   The edamame could have used more salt.   Rather on the bland side, but a sprinkling of salt would have helped.  I mean, what can one do to edamame??  The tempura doesn't come with rice, which can be ordered for $1.   I debated, and figured I had enough to eat with the tempura, but I am not used to eating Japanese fried food without rice.

Yes, I would go back for dinner.   I have been here prior.  I mean, adding the soy sauce to the dipping sauce isn't that big of a deal, and I'm sure not having enough salt/seasoning on the edamame is no big deal as well.   I normally don't order the Americanized sushi rolls, so I would not have ordered that version of makisushi.   I would imagine other makisushis at this restaurant are good, albeit I have no idea.

After my first taste of their Chicken Parmigiana sandwich I was hooked. I love the meatball sandwich as well. But my favorite is definitely the Italian Sausage served with roasted green peppers and onions with the marinara sauce on the roll of your choice. Talk about foodie nirvana; The Italian Sausage sandwich does it for me.

I keep coming here because the food is excellent and the pricing is reasonable. One time my family members ordered half sandwiches of the same item and they gave us the full sandwich pricing which was a discount from half sandwich pricing. They didn't have to do that. But that's just one of the ways that they look out for their customers. This place gets really busy and it can be a challenge to find seating during the busy lunch and dinner hours.

We got a bay on the 2nd level. 2nd/ 3rd level is key! We ordered a bucket of corona lites and I ordered a margarita. We also ordered chips and guac. I will post a picture of the guac and salsa dishes. The appetizer is called chips and guac but underneath it also says you get salsa with it. When they brought it out, it was the tiniest guac dish I've seen and the salsa dish was much larger. My margarita was awful it was probably 98% margarita mix that was super sweet. Also it didn't have salt on the rim (on the menu it shows with salt on the rim). We were disappointed with the appetizer and I was disappointed in the margarita too.

I was online looking through reviews for other burger places when I found this place. I noticed that the reviews seemed pretty good so I decided to check it out. 

So on a Friday afternoon my buddy and I walked in to this old school looking building searching for what I was hoping was going to be one tasty burger ( think Samuel L. Jackson in pulp fiction) and I was right! The burgers are a nice size given some of the prices (7 bucks for a burger)?  

My tasty burger featured American cheese and a well done patty that looked like someone had made it at their house. Large disk shaped patty grilled the way I like it and ready for the several toppings I would choose to add from their topping bar. That 's right they have a section set up where you decide what you want to add to your sandwich. Cool, huh? OK so now that the good stuff has been said let 's get to the bad. 

First as the saying goes all that glitters is not gold was talking about this place. From the old looking tables that featured chairs that looked like they where taken from the set of Roseann, to the small and expensive order of fries I received there where some areas that needed improvement asap. The lady taking our order was not the most friendly person you will ever meet and the bar section was to close to the dinning room section so you get the full effect of being a loud drinker without having to pay 4-5 bucks for a beer. 

Also some of the decorations looked kind of dusty like they where kept outside during the last dust storm. So if you want good burgers then this is a good place for that. But if you want a cool hangout spot you may want to pop in a DVD of cheers and grab that burger to go.",2,2009-08-06 20:29

I didn't really know what this place about except for the fact that it served brunch and that it was in Scottsdale. The suite number is 195 off of Marshall Way. It was a little tricky for us to find it being that it was our first time. There are off street parking and if that's not available, there's a free parking garage just kitty corner of the restaurant. 

We made reservations for 3 for 11:45, the place was packed so we were glad that we made reservations. 

We started off with some brunch cocktails:
OLDTOWN HOUND $9
rutte gin, st. germain, arizona grapefruit
BELLINI $8
peach purée, peach liqueur, smirnoff vodka, prosecco
IVY & GINGER $11
smirnoff vodka, canton ginger, pineapple, sparkling wine 

I had the Ivy & Ginger, you definitely taste the pineapple - nice refreshing drink. They had the Bellini and Oldtown Hound - both of them enjoyed their drinks.

I ordered the SMOKED SALMON* (toasted bagel, tomato, caper & red onion)  for $11 on an Everything Bagel. This was not the best Lox Bagel I've ever had; the salmon was a little saltier than I'd like. The nice part is this came disassembled so you could put as much creme cheese and toppings as you'd like. 

My boyfriend had the EGGS BENEDICT* (shaved ham & basil hollandaise) for $13.5. This was also not best eggs benedict I've ever tasted either. The waitress gave us a heads up about the eggs coming a little translucent which was nice. I'm assuming they have had a lot of questions about it.

The * means that it contains raw foods and may cause health hazards; ie the eggs/salmon and tomato (jk about the tomato).

Our friend had the LAMB GYRO (grilled pita, tzatziki, tomato, onion & feta) $14. He said he liked it.

I almost forgot.... I had the cinnamon roll. I ordered one and it was big enough for 3 people to share. It was delicious! It had to be the best thing I tasted there!

What I loved about this place - the decor/atmosphere/drinks, cinnamon roll and customer service.

House margarita was pretty good, but  overpriced ($7) considering the glass was filled to the rim with ice, resulting in a rather small drink.  Both salsas were tasty (red tomato-based and green tomatillo), both spicy but the heat was not overpowering.  I love the ala carte idea for the taco menu as there are many to try, but found the food to be less than impressive.  I had a chicken taco (pollo asado) and beef (carne asada).  The chicken was bland and at room temperature.  The beef was a little more flavorful, but still only mildly warm.  My husband tried the lobster and fish tacos.  Both were overcooked and he complained there was not enough fish and too much cabbage.  He also ordered grilled street corn, but they apparently forgot to grill it.

I appreciate that it's semi-self serve, because that means I can refill my coffee as much as I want and grab any condiments I want (Cholula! Varieties of Tabasco! Ketchup!), but I think the price-point is a little steep for this type of service. Almost $50 for 4 at breakfast? I dunno. Seemed a little ridiculous.

This is soooo not true with Roy's.  Each restaurant carries the vibe of the city it's in.  The SF Roy's pulls you in from Mission street with the copper topped bar and two level open dining room.  It pulsates with the City vibe, but has just enough of the Hawaiian undercurrant to remind you where you are eating.  The Phoenix location has FLW influenced touches and feels both contemporary and familiar.

The same goes with the food.  I've had a half dozen dishes on the menu, and while I hate to say it, everything is good here.  I'm partial to short ribs and their's are the version I compare others against: fork tender with a rich sauce, not fatty or tough and resting on a bed of mashed potatoes that manage to be creamy without being dense.  Seafood is a specialty.  Their seared tuna comes with a wasabi and a mustard sauce and both complement this delicious dish.  For a great value, order off the seasonal Prix fix menu. On my last visit, we ordered one prix fix and two appitizers for my husband and I.  There's was more than enough food and we were able to try a wider variety of dishes.  Oh, and the shrimp risotto app came with two monster shrimps, perfectly cooked, of course.  We also got the seared scallops, divine in a lemongrass cream sauce.

Service is a standout here.  No matter what you ask for the staff are attentive without being overbearing.  I always feel like a welcome guest when dining here.  And just to be clear, we are not big spenders, but I feel like a high roller no matter what we order.

Now it has been my mantra that nothing is worth more than, at most, a 30 minutes wait. First time in my life, at the persistent insistence of my son Basit, that I grudgingly waited almost an hour and half, standing in line, for my food. 
Lemme tell you. It was worth every minute of the excruciating wait after getting in line well before 15 minutes of opening time. Does that tell you how long the line was. 
Each of us got a pound of their beef brisket, grabbed one of the tables and then gently floated into brisket heaven. IT DON'T GET NO BETTER THAN THIS!!!
This is brisket at its best. Forget Texas, forget Kansas City. Brisket heaven is in Tempe, AZ. 
Did I mention that my son actually got another pound to take back to Colorado?",5,2018-04-16 9:43

I don't think either of us will be back. The wait was only a couple in front of us, but took almost 25 minutes to be seated, and the way the restaurant was laid out, we had to basically stand in front of the door while waiting.  Also, I had to chase down the waiter to even get on the wait list.

Once seated, I opened the menu, ready to get the black bean burger I'd seen online...their only non-egg vegetarian item.  I had purposely scouted the menu online before coming in, since they didn't seem super veg friendly.

Yeah. Apparently, they no longer serve veggie burgers. Nope.  So when I asked our server, as a vegetarian, what I could get, she told me there was some sort of dish that one of the servers made with cottage cheese, mushrooms and avocado.  I had no option but to ask for that.

When it came out, after a good deal of time, it was a small cup of oily mushrooms, a plate with half an avocado on it, and a small cup of cottage cheese.  Um. Gross.

I stole a piece of my partner's toast, mixed in ketchup with the mushrooms, and put it on the toast with a little avocado on top. It was ok, but I could have made it better myself, and for less than the almost $7 they charged me for my ""meal.""

Add to that the homophobia and transphobia we felt, plus the coffee refill guy walking past my partner's empty cup not once, not twice, but three times, and we'll not be back. Which is too bad, because my partner love love loved her Denver omlette and hashbrowns.  Folks, it takes more than good food to make a good restaurant.",2,2010-03-17 17:36

This place has an awesome front patio, and it's off-the-beaten path so you don't get the street traffic that plagues a lot of other outdoor patios.

On my most recent visit (only my 4th overall), I was here for a roll-off dinner with friends and co-workers as my almost three year stint in Phoenix was coming to a close. We were seated on the outside patio in the corner. The staff promptly came out and greeted us and made sure we were taken care of.

For our group of nine, they put together a great sample platter of appetizers and charcuterie. For dinner I opted for the Lamb Ragout. And for dessert, they again put together an amazing dessert sampler for us.

Needless to say, I am loving this area in Old Town. The food from House and other restaurants in this area are eons better than the other areas in Old Town, namely north and east Old Town. Great food and atmosphere.

97NmGZPG_8QNDPLHK2YLng,9r0a2I4kzFHzrQy6PhqmOA,46hnat0aLao-qYWZkN9aBg,"Ay ay ay ay!  This place has so many crazy rules!  Two are listed below...

1. can't usually accommodate big parties unless the party has 25 people or more and then the banquet room can be used.  For a party of 18, this was a bit frustrating but we were there for a birthday party and wasn't going to stress about it.

2.  When you order a pitcher of margarita, you can only have four glasses.  So for six, you have to order two pitchers! not a bad rule, I guess, but is there a need for this rule at all?

I was forewarned that the food is especially spicy.  I can attest with minor burns on my tongue from the salsa as evidence.  I am sensitive to spicy food but was really intent on trying the house specialty, adovada, which is as spicy as the salsa.  I ordered chimichanga with beef adovada a la carte, since I was full from chips and spicy salsa and two pitchers of margarita!  I also asked for a side salad but they don't serve side salad, so the server offered to add extra lettuce garnish on the plate.

My chimichanga was plated on a platter with tons of shredded iceberg lettuce surrounding it.  WOW for the lettuce garnish.  Was it prescience, common sense, or clairvoyance that made me order a pile of lettuce with my meal?  Whatever the impetus for this action, it was a smart move as the adovada was on the salty side, packed with spicy heat!  If you take the salt away, it would just be spicy.  If you take the spice away, it would just be salty.  Chili peppers do have a flavor to them, and I like it when that tartness, or bitter-sour flavor comes through, and the spice envelopes it in texture.  The spiciness was so poignant that it numbed my tongue a bit, unable to taste, and which could explain why it was salted the way it was.  The additional sides of the lettuce, sour cream, and guacamole really rounded out the chimi, and I ended up enjoying my meal.  the third pitcher of margarita could have helped reach the level of enjoyment.

Los Dos Molinos seems to be a favorite place but for reasons of which I am not certain.  I liked my meal, but was not spectacular, the prices were not so good that I would come back for cheap eats, the location was too far to add to my rotation...

My rec, is to go with three other people, (four total) who like the adrenaline rush of super spicy salsa.",2,2008-08-26 17:58

When you first walk in, you enter the dining area, and then the register is in the back. I arrived first, so I wasn't sure where to go as there were no servers or a hostess. There were some customers waiting for their food in the back at the register/counter so I headed back there and they told me to just put my order in at the counter. I ordered the red curry and said that it was ""for here"" then sat down. One of my friends showed up and sat with me and asked where she should order - I told her I had no idea and we just took a menu since no one working at the restaurant was to be found once again. Eventually the man who had taken my order came to our table and took my friend's order. About 10 minutes later her food came, but mine didn't. Then it came out to go - including with plastic silver ware, etc. 

The rest of our party showed up so we moved to a larger table (most of the restaurant is 4 top booth seating). It was hard to get the server to bring me water, etc.  (I guess because my order was ""to go""?), even though I had already paid and tipped well over 20% (eating in amount).

I have to disagree with Anthony - the level of spice was not even white person spicy - it was just not spicy at all. The only person who seemed happy had ordered their food ""Thai hot."" My red curry was ok, not disgusting but not as complex of a flavor profile as Thai should be. The curry was also very saucy with few veggies/ meat.

I'd give it another shot though, since it might have been a fluke as they seemed understaffed.",3,2013-09-07 1:25

Patio:  great patio for groups! The area is fenced in but doesn't block the outdoor experience that is so nice in the Arizona sunshine.  

Food: The happy hour menu can be found here:  http://www.modernmargarita.com/menus/ModernMargarita-HappyHour.pdf

I recommend starting with the $3 chips and salsa flight or $3 beer-battered onion rings (at those prices you can't go wrong!) The veggie and steak tostadas are only $4!  I seriously make a meal out of the happy hour menu 

Crowd:  The crowd can be a mixed bag-- there are some sketchy cougars prepartying for Blue Martini (that place is a sh@tshow), working professionals, and locals.  

Staff: our server was a total peach and didn't complain about splitting the bill.  The bartenders gave my small group free shots when we told them we were celebrating a new job!  Most importantly, the manager offered to charge my iphone!  It was much appreciated!

Went on a Friday afternoon and was seated right away even though they were pretty busy. The decor is pretty contemporary with some of the larger tables with bench seats. Seems like they try to make it like a open casual home feeling. 

Shared the Denver Omelette,  asked them to substitute asparagus for bell peppers and they had no problem. Also substituted the buttermilk pancakes for the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes. Also shared the fruit Waffles and ham kaseri crepes.

The omelette was good but if this makes sense tasted more like a bunch of scrambled eggs than an omelette. The pancakes were good but did not wow me.when the pancakes came out it looked like a glob of melted marshmallows on top of the pancakes. The hash browns were good and crispy the way they should be.

First of all the place was absolutely chaotic! Servers, food runners and bussers running into each other. I watched a table get wiped down 3 times by 3 different people with a dirty cloth that smelled like a school cafeteria. There seemed to be no communication with each other bc everyone seemed confused. I ordered a juice which took longer than it should bc they have one juice area and it was crowded with servers. 
Now for what I really minded...
My food took about 35 minutes to come out and when it did, it was all wrong and tasted terrible. Hash browns are made in house but even after ordering them crispy, they came out wet and undercooked in the center. The only thing crispy was the outside. My eggs were ordered over medium but came out so undercooked. Just white slime on top. The sausage links are butterflied and you get 2 links instead of 3 like every other breakfast place. They obviously slice them so it looks like more. I didnt really mind that bc I can never finish 3, but I didn't like the taste. My English muffin was thick and doughy, not toasted. DISASTER!

We went for my wife's 30th birthday.  My dad decided to join us.  My wife ordered steak and shrimp, my dad ordered steak, I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.  I was craving it.

We got our appetizer's.  Dad got snails, wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again, how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasn't about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams.

The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server I've had this dish many times before and this is not the way it's supposed to be.  He told me this is what it's supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldn't even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didn't come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was.

While I was waiting for the server to return, I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dad's steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too, but it's my wife's birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?  Fortunately, that came out fine.

So we left hungry and $300 poorer.  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now, it is not worth it.  I am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down.",1,2009-08-11 1:42

I would give it five stars for the ambiance and decor - it's a quaint, rustic place and I loved everything about how it looks!

Be sure to dress warm though - they use the outside seating as the waiting area. There are a few heaters, but it's still chilly out! Thankfully, we only had to wait about 20 minutes.

For our starer, we ordered the salad with mozzarella, arugula and prosciutto and though the mozzarella was very good, the salad was somehow too salty. The bread and vinegar was delish. I believe my roommate said the vinegar was the best part of the meal - which I agree with. It was an extra $2, but if you're going to order bread, then it's worth it.

I ordered the spaghetti and was disappointed. I prefer angel hair pasta and this was thick pasta with nothing special to the sauce or noodles. Thankfully, we ordered a side of meatballs - those were amazing and really helped the spaghetti. I also tried the gnocchi that my friend ordered and thought it was terrible - very bland. 

We all split the flourless cake for dessert. It was okay - but tasted more like a brownie than a cake. It had a pure coco flavor just lightly sweetened, which was unexpected but good. However, it would have been better if were truly a cake.

They have two counters, one for meal type orders and another for the deli (sandwiches). A gentleman was at the meal counter ordering and I walked up to the deli counter.

No one was working the deli yet so I waited. A few minutes passed, people walked in and out of the kitchen, the other guy was still doing a long order.  I passed the time by checking out my phone.

Another customer got behind me in the deli line.  He also pulled out his phone after a couple of minutes as well.  We were both just hanging out when he strikes up a conversation.  I was surprised to hear an older guy with a heavy accent quoting a line from Ferris Bueller so I give him props for that.

We fiinished our chat, the meal line was on to the next customer, workers were coming in and out, stocking shelves, Another person got behind us in the deli line.

By this point I was getting pretty hungry so I left the restaurant to get something to eat.",1,2018-03-24 17:48

Fantastic and plentiful happy hour drink specials! Had specials on beer, mixed drinks and shots. I was starving so I skipped the happy hour snacks and ordered a burger. I got the Belfast Burger and it was sooo good! The beef patty tasted great. Good quality. Excellent flavor. 

Service was great. Prices were about right. They even had some ladies going around giving promo shots of whiskey. Great timing on our part!

The one time we did have an issue with a meal the staff were very engaging, apologetic and wanted to make things right.

The atmosphere is fun, it can get a little loud at the bar end of the building but that adds to the fun. They have multiple flatscreen TVs in the bar area.",4,2013-08-17 19:45

I haven't had the opportunity to dine in but, I'm planning to very soon. Twice now I've ordered take out and each time the process was simple, quick and friendly. First, I tried the chorizo tacos which were hands down extremely comparable to the real thing. I didn't even think twice about having real eggs or beef chorizo. You can tell the cooks take great care to pay attention to details. The grilled corn tortillas added an extra touch. Next up I decided to give a burger a try. The garbanzo, red potato burger will not disappoint you as it provides a well melded combination of perfectly seasoned ingredients that will keep you from ever missing an all beef patty. The dish is served with your choice of French fries or a salad and not just your run of the mills salads an arugula based salad with cherry tomatoes and a balsamic dressing.

I decided I had to try this place out. I ordered the two giant pork egg rolls which was about $6 after tax was extremely disappointed.

I love ridiculously Americanized cream cheese and avocado-stuffed deep-fried makizushi (if you can even still call it that). And I make no apologies! Purists be damned. That being said, Sakana's rainbow roll, philly roll, and crunchy eel rolls were totally melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Crunchy eel had to be my favorite. Flaming phoenix was pretty good, too. 

I have to back up a bit.... I started with the ahi tataki salad. It's way bigger in person than it looked in the photo, and sooooo good (note: I normally HATE salads, just ordered it for the seared tuna and ended up eating a good amount of the salad itself). I also tried the spicy tuna roll and it was a big disappointment... BARELY any spice and the tuna tasted a little fishy, definitely not as scrumptious as the tuna in the salad. But I had so many other yummy things to nosh on, I didn't mind abandoning the spicy tuna. 

I'm not sure if it's a regular thing, but they had 50c appetizers if you order a Kirin. The prices on all the dishes were totally reasonable. They DON'T have a full bar, I'm not sure why there are 3 votes for that.",4,2008-12-21 7:13
ER5_cIjOHld7FnGH4BrgPA,htmygo8u4Ae4kKiLaIF5Sg,cPEo3-TmIqCwHLFGKZgwGg,"A very homey place. The chef came out and personally recommended some dishes, and told us that they could cook anything not on the menu for you if you brought the ingredients or ordered in advanced. 

We ordered the meat pies that were highly reviewed, the potstickers, and the beef stew noodles. The meat pies were on the salty and oily side. The potstickers had a savory filling, but the outside was not pan fried long enough so there was no crunch. The beef stew noodles featured a very rich broth with hints of star anise. 

I personally would skip the meat pies/potstickers and order dumplings with beef noodles next time. I'd recommend this place if you're looking for authentic northern Asian food in Tempe!",4,2015-03-06 18:29

The Taro Smoothie on the other hand was just average. Around $6 for a large. I'll try to get something that's more their specialty next time like the Lotta Horchata or the gelato bars.

Z9zSaDQ7Y7bkHYio-vVg5Q,Yej5B4nd8PqpHMQcmCTDrg,oD-C0IhodDOtWWOiNm2txA,"This is some CLASSY brunch.  I love it.

Hot damn, it was warm this morning, but not enough to make a difference on a 5-star place like The Farm at South Mountain.  I was in a rush to try this place out this weekend before it closed.  (FYI, it closes every summer from June - September.)

You pull up to the place in the midst of this vast city of ours to find a huge, and shady (in a good way) farm before you.  At the Morning Glory Cafe, the small menu has just the right mix of items to please just about anyone.  Lots of veggie options to be had here, btw (Bonnie would DROOL with desire here).

The food is really incredible.  They had my favorite dish on the menu - croque madame.  It had eggs, and some delicious asiago cheese and black forest ham on some crusty artisanal bread.  Ahh.  It was missing the bechamel sauce, but it made up for it with freshly-grown asparagus.  How did they know that's my favorite veggie?  I attribute it to kismet, of course.  It was accompanied by some terrific oven roasted potatoes baked in some spices and oil.  Nice...

The patio is cute in a rustic way.  Think checker tablecloths and white plastic chairs.  Not exactly sexy, but hey, it fits in the grand scheme of the farm.  They have a self serve area for water, lemonade and tea.  

The mimosas here are the best part.  For only $7.50 you get your own mini champagne bottle and orange juice.  So you're getting the better end of the bargain with about a mimosa and a half! 

Service here was a bit slow to start.  But after paying the check I spot a wandering blueberry scone that is calling my name.  (Even better, is their scones are featured in Cooking Light magazine too.  Man I love this place.) So I give in, place an order and ask for it to go.  She brings it out.  I ask to pay in cash, since she already ran my debit card, and she says ""Don't worry about it.""  

CLASSY.  Classy, with a C.  The scone was DELICIOUS, btw.  Nice touch, and I leave her an extra tip for it. 

Prices are higher than average for Phoenix.  Expect to throw down about $40 for two.  But let me tell ya, that will be the best $40 you've spent in a while. 

I am now eager to try the other restaurants here.  Now if only September would hurry up and arrive....",5,2007-06-02 22:07

I ordered the baked stuffed lobster.  There was more of a thin, overcooked layer on top of the lobster than being stuffed... It was so thin and dry that it was hard to taste any of the seafood in the stuffing.  It is served still in the lobster, my personal preference is to be served the lobster as a filet out of it's shell.  Overall, it was rather tough, dry and flavorless.  The sides were unimpressive.

Our first time there and the staff could not be more helpful and informative. It was really easy peasy, you order lunch, they give you a number and wait for your little picnic basket. Lots of places to sit, free refills of their delicious lemonade or iced tea.  Dog friendly (there is a dog station, but it's a good idea to bring your own waste bags and water bowl). After lunch we took a leisurely stroll around the entire grounds and were just amazed at all the different places to just sit and relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. Definitely going back, the food is just fresh and delicious, and the farm closes for the summer so definitely want to take advantage of this place a few more times.",5,2017-03-05 23:32

We started off by trying a couple of their appetizers; the crab wontons and the coconut shrimp. Both were pretty tasty and were served with a sweet and tangy tropical sauce that I quite enjoyed. I do wish that the crab wontons would have been a bit crunchier though. For our main dish we split the ""F'n Sliders"" which were these mini burgers loaded with strips of steak. They weren't too bad, but were pretty messy and hard to eat without feeling like a slob. The best thing we had was probably the Tom Kai Gai soup... slightly spicy but very flavorful. This is the type of place that'd probably work a little better with more of a Pei-Wei's type of set up,,, it has more of a casual, almost bar-like atmosphere... it doesn't feel like you're at an Asian restaurant when you're here. 

In the end... it's a cool concept (Asian dishes with more traditional American fusions) it just didn't wow me like it could have. Still it's a solid spot with a fun menu that you should try. 3.5/5.",3,2010-01-14 18:23

Called in an order to go and picked it up from the drive-thru.  Got home and opened up our packages to a huge disappointment.  I ordered the South of the Border omelette and couldn't believe that the fruit and sour cream were both thrown on top of the omelette.  The fruit should have been packaged separately (hot and cold don't belong together) and the sour cream should have been in a cup by itself.  The pepper jack cheese in the omelette was of the processed variety (think Velveeta.)  I would think that a place that tries to be higher end would use quality ingredients.  The second order was fried chicken and waffles but that's all we got.  No butter, no syrup.  So instead of eating our meals we had to make a trip to the grocery store to buy syrup since the restaurant was too far away.  When I called the restaurant to point this out I was told (after a very long and awkward pause) that the chicken and waffles would be taken off the bill.",2,2012-05-31 2:05

So I got there early. I hooked myself up to super fast wi-fi. I cursed myself for having stuffed myself already as the menu looked delicious. After hugs were shared I watched enviously as Amanda returned to the table with wine. At lunch time.

Apparently Happy Hour is a twelve hour thing.
TWELVE HOURS.

Did you hear me?
(Dine in only. This is stipulated on the menu. Who tries to take HH to go? Apparently SOME PEOPLE. 32 Shea does have a drive thru.)

So from 6AM to 6PM folks can enjoy the following:
$4 bottled craft beer
$5 wine, mimosa, bloody mary
$6 martinis, cocktails

AND then (!) they have a 2-hr munchie hour
4pm-6pm (again, dine in only kids)
$3 bruschetta
$5 munchie menu (which they put on the chalk board)

See here's the thing. If you're a writer, this place is dangerous. You'd never get a damn thing done. You'd show up bright and early for breakfast (which is served until noon), enjoy coffee, move onto a smoothie and then lunch. (The green smoothie is *excellent*.) At some point a beve would make sense, right? And then, well, it's drinking time?

This is an adorable cozy space. You will fall in love with it. Oops! I got all sorts of excited and left something out. You place your order up front at the cashier and food is brought to you. Tables are cleared for you. 

I took a menu to keep in my car. YES, I did that. This place isn't in my neck of the woods. However, I cannot wait to grab food the next opportunity I'm up here again!

UPDATE: While you're here be sure to try the New Mexican burrito. The green salsa is to die for. (I'm hoping they start selling this to go soon.) Garlic, jalapeños, cilantro, tomatoes, onion, and some other heaven. I can't remember what else Rebecca, the super cool owner, described with zest. She's currently sporting purple short hair. All the employes rock. There's a punky and fun vibe going on here. Good times :)",5,2014-09-12 0:32

Then, I would get distracted by someone wanting to race down Jefferson, after my keys were handed to me, which happened to be the only exciting thing that woke me up out of my stupor from the yawner games.

That was last season. I haven't been back to watch a Suns game since. However, I finally made it to Arrogant Butcher for dinner with my Beloved wife.

This is now, to me, one of the bright spots on Jefferson street, in Downtown Phoenix!

We came here on a Saturday afternoon, and were introduced to the subdued elegance that is the interior of this establishment. The layout is open, inviting, and bustling with a fair amount of patrons.

The hostesses, servers, and bussers were cordial, attentive, polite and efficient.

I had chose the Prime Rib Au Jus with Mashed Potatoes. Although the mashed potatoes weren't particularly spectacular, the slow roasted Prime Rib had a wonderfully succulent texture. Additionally, it was well seasoned and delectable.. Each bite was just scrumptious.

About the only downside of my meal selection was the asparagus. It seemed to have been overdone, then chilled which took away most of the recognizable flavors that is inherent in this particular vegetable.

My wife had the Green Chile Stew. That too was a big hit, and the addition of a fried egg on top made for a particularly appetizing and visually appealing meal. She indicated that it was more Chili, than Stew. But, that did not detract from her overall positive comments and impression of her meal selection.

The Salmon Rillette was also particularly notable as a spread on the wonderfully prepared and grilled bread. Simply savory!",4,2017-02-11 4:31

YNrHV6NW71uleX5cKokw9Q,oGUrhMb_e2bPBKhdvqHIRQ,1qwkbN3wu3AGDxMTXVz2gA,"To recycle a joke from Pineapple Express (and remove the profanity), TopGolf is like if a driving range and a skeeball game had a kid, and then in a different part of the country a bowling alley and a Dave and Busters had a kid, and then THOSE kids grew up, met, and had a kid - BAM! - Topgolf! Time for another episode of Pros and Cons!

Pro: Options for everyone - there are difficult and easy golf games, all built around on the GPS tracked golf balls and large targets in the ground on the range grass and based on accuracy, distance, direction, etc.  They have clubs of all sizes ready to go, along with shuffleboard, pool, some TVs with sports or Xbox Kinects...

Con: Not that great for kids - a little dangerous if they're on the driving range deck - I can't remember if this one has minigolf (some TopGolfs do)

Pro: Servers take orders for food and drink and bring the food right to your station - pub and sports bar type options, plenty of adult beverages that can even come in pitchers, and super-American options like loaded nachos, Chicken and Waffle sandwiches, and injectable donuts.

Con: Had to go through a pretty extensive sign-up process for a guest pass - took 10-15 minutes - just seems like it's a marketing info grab and they could do without it.

Pro: One of the best times I've had, just a very creative combination of a number of awesome things

Con: Super big missed opportunity? When the cart zips around to collect the balls, all the computers should just say ""HIT THE CART!"" for a few minutes - everyone is thinking it already, and it seems like the GPS could track if you did it or not - just put a couple nets on the cart like sails on a pirate ship.  It would be an epic community event and would look super cool like a mix of ""NYPD! Hit the chopper"" from The Other Guys and the archers from the last battle in Braveheart.

We came in on a Friday night for a pick up order, but stayed to enjoy the live music at the bar for a while as well. Also stoked because they deliver to my neighborhood, which I would've guessed is outside the delivery area. 

Pizza was good. Crust good, not too doughy or crispy. I would suggest not going too crazy on the custom toppings because they can add up and be pricy. Luckily the girl at the counter was nice and warned us the pizza we were crafting was going to end up being pretty expensive, so we took her suggestion to revise and it was much more reasonable. They're definitely my go to pizza in the neighborhood. Have ordered from them several times and they're always consistent.

It came with two types of cheese (one edible, one chalky and flavorless) and three types of meet (the salami was alright, the other two were not). Although the appetizer platter was generous (which is good because it cost $15) there wasn't much on it worth eating. The sandwich was alright, but the pizza was greasy and ungenerous (it seemed like it was pre-made, frozen, then cooked). The only upshot is the nice outdoor seating and great wine menu, with reasonably priced glasses. If I came back here again, which I doubt I will, I would just stick to the wine. Lastly, the waitress was nice and helpful, but she also complained to us about some of the other customers at the restaurant, which was quite awkward.",1,2012-04-01 5:29

The crab and dried scallop fried rice was as good as the best fried rice I've eaten while living in Hong Kong. The rice kernels were perfectly al dente, not greasy, well-seasoned with the right restraint and the breath of the wok shined through deliciously.  Fried rice and noodles shows the real skill of a chef - it requires good control of heat and timing. 

We also had the lobster with house special sauce. The lobster was plucked live from the tanks and weighed 2.75 lbs ($15/lb) so totaled approx. $40. The sauce was addictively spicy with sliced jalapenos and ample ground black pepper with the crunch of green onion tops - a little less sugar in the sauce would have made it perfect.

Young pea leaves are one of my favorite vegetables and usually available only at restaurants that see a lot of traffic from Chinese customers who appreciate them. They require some plucking to remove the less tender tendrils so tend to cost more. At Nee House, it cost $13.50 per plate. This is on the high side but I cannot resist the flavor and texture of the small tender dark green leaves so have to order it wherever it's served.  I asked for it to be cooked with garlic. It was cooked to the perfect level (nothing is worse than overcooked vegetables), albeit a bit oily.

The fried rice is more than enough reason to go back to Nee House.",4,2010-08-27 5:59

The chicken was tender and juicy, the aioli was on point, the bacon was crispy, and the bread was warm and soft; everything about it was amazing. I am probably going to go back tomorrow to try the BLT, but honestly, everything sounds SO good.

After a scheduling snafu at The Blue Hound, The Arrogant Butcher graciously accepted our party of 20.  I was dubious about how the service would be due to the large group, but they exceeded my expectations.  We had a dedicated server who was extremely nice and resembled a cheery Christmas Hobbit.  Drinks came out fairly quickly and after a short wait at the bar, we were shown to a private dining room.  

The have a really adventurous cocktail menu so if you're feeling brave, give it a go.  Bring your smartphone as you may have to google many of the ingredients (I enjoy exposure to new things so this is definitely a plus for me).  

The pretzel fondue appetizer is heaven on earth encased in doughy salty cheesy goodness.  The chicken stroganoff was pretty fantastic as well and they get extra points for house made pasta.  I found it odd but charming that the menu listed ""frozen peas.""  (More points for honesty!)  My dining companions seemed very pleased with their meals and one person was especially enthusiastic about the mussels and oysters.  

Desserts were fantastic as well.  The warm peanut butter cup is nothing short of amazing.  It's the kind of thing you would say is ""just okay"" in order to avoid sharing.  The salted caramel pudding was delicious as well.  (And if you all could turn that salted caramel pudding into bread pudding, I will personally head up a new religion devoted to it.)

We arrived and were sat quickly. Ordered hot tea to drink and that was brought to us quickly. Took about 10 minutes before someone came back to take our order even though we were ready when she took our drink order.

We ordered the family meal for two and an order of BBQ Pork Lo Mein. They brought out the sweet & sour pork on time and then it was about 10 minutes before the next item was brought out, broccoli beef. We had eaten about half of the sweet & sour pork by the time the broccoli beef arrived. We started eating the beef and finishing the sweet & sour. I had to flag someone down to ask where the rest of our meal was (fried rice and lo mein) to which she ran back and grabbed the fried rice.

About 15 minutes later we still had not received the lo mein so I waved to our waitress and from across the room she yell ""oh yeah, the noodles"" and then went back to clearing tables and didn't go check on the lo mein. By this time we're just about completely finished with our meal and 10 minutes later another girl brings out some lo mein and says this isn't the meat you ordered but asked if we wanted it or they would have to make a new order. I really wanted the lo mein for left-overs for lunch at work on Monday so I told her we would eat what she brought so we didn't have to wait any longer.

We asked that she box up the lo mein which she did and she brought the ticket. I was sure she would provide some discount on the lo mein since we didn't get it with our meal and we didn't get what we ordered. Nope, full price.

They did not check on us once throughout our meal and I had to flag someone down each time.

Hostess sat us at the end banquette with an open table next to us, which is fine because SO and I are admittedly not the touchy-feely types.

My 14 year old son got the stuffed pizza with REAL cheese from Wisconsin (funny because the take home box said exactly that it was real cheese and not the fake stuff, lmfao).

One of the friendly staff said please let me help you with serving the first slice, because the cheese never stopped it was stretched 5 feet up and still a long stretch of cheese WOW WOW WOW!!!! I LOVED it sooo much and my son even more.  Okay so my boy is eating his main meal and me and mom got a diablo shrimp and a lady scampi shrimp. Wow  both were so tasty. A bit spicy on the scampi and even a heck of a lot more on the Diablo (this was very creamy like Alfredo sauce but kicking it up several notches). Biggest shrimps I have seen on a $15.99 menu. 6 large shrimp (half a pound at least) in your pasta with special sauce and an 8"" slice of French bread drenched in garlic, butter and parsley. Also they will bring you fresh shredded Parmesan cheese. So we have a full menu of spicy delicious Italian food, with plenty of cheese, oh and best pizza we have had in a very long time.

The Sonoran breakfast burrito sounded great-- eggs, chorizo, green chilies, jack cheese, and salsa are among my favorite things to put in a burrito.  This is gonna be awesome, I thought reading the description.  I was hungry and excited about breakfast.  Oh, how let down I was with that first bite! Reality intruded on my fantasy breakfast with extreme prejudice.  I had been burrito- blocked!
First of all, the ""meat"" was not chorizo.  Chorizo is deliciously greasy (that good red grease that lets you know its for real) and bursting with spicy flavor.  My burrito had ""chorizo"" in it -- flavorless Sysco breakfast crumbles.  There were also some green things that may have been chilies, and some onions, but neither tasted like the things they were masquerading as.  The only thing I tasted in the whole thing was the splat of tomato salsa on top.  Seriously, the breakfast burrito from McDonald's had more flavor than this poor creature they served me! And you know I can't stand  McDonald's, it is the court of last resort!
I was glad to see a decent selection of fruit on my $1.25 upcharge fruit plate.  No complaints there, at least until our server knocked the table flag (the standup display advertising specials, don't know what its officially called) over in the middle of it.
Service was not great either, which also fed my irritation about breakfast.

The plus side is that the sushi is inexpensive and it was delicious.  This restaurant serves the sushi rolls and apps conveyor belt style.  This means you are choosing various plates of sushi which are color-coded by the plates and those colors correspond to pricing.  the plates of sushi have lids on them so that (hopefully) germs are not attaching to the rolls as they roll by people in the restaurant.  One major issue that I did NOT like was that our table was not bussed throughout the evening.  We had piles of plates and lids and straws laying on the table.  I tried to pile things so that we had room to eat but I cannot stand having so much dirty things on the table while eating.  Last, as a seasoned sushi eater, I would suggest being picky about the rolls that you do choose.  I would have also appreciated more nigiri, but I don't think you are able to order sushi?

We had reservations for an early dinner (5:30pm) and we were seated as soon as we arrived. We decided to splurge on a bottle of wine and selected the Char Sui Pork Belly Steamed Buns as an appetizer. They were very good and the only complaint we had was the sauce served on them was inconsistent in its quantity. The first had very little (too sparse) while the middle one seemed perfect and then the third one seemed to have just a tad too much so it was a bit overpowering. But the pork belly was cooked perfectly and had a very nice crispiness on the outside of it. Our entrees arrived and I opted for the Classic Four (Hibachi Grilled Salmon, Misoyaki Butterfish, Blackened Ahi Tuna, and Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi). They were all fabulous with my favorites being the Butterfish and the Salmon and my least favorite the Mahi Mahi - which totally surprised me as I was expecting it to be my favorite. It just seemed to lack the flavor the others had and seemed a little too mushy. Hubby ordered the Shellfish Sampler which consisted of Lobster Tail, Seared Sea Scallops, Teppanyaki Shrimp, and Asparagus. His also came with a Lobster Red Curry Sauce and Creamy Jasmine Rice. He loved his as well and although a couple of the shrimps seemed to be a tad over cooked, they were still delicious! We also got sides of the Asparagus with Beurre Blanc and the Lump Crab Fried Rice. The Asparagus was amazing and cooked perfectly! Hubby couldn't quit raving about them! The Fried Rice was okay but nothing spectacular honestly. Service was great and our waitress was very attentive and brought us a free Chocolate Molten Lava Soufflé with ice cream for our anniversary. Very much appreciated and ooey, gooey deliciousness! All in all a very good meal and one that I will remember and can't wait to repeat!",5,2018-07-09 22:16
K91fNZd1AMi5vpIckFAymw,6jz_Yr6_AP2WWLbj9gGDpA,zidkKI_N1OPxsiddTOQH_Q,"4 stars for now but definitely a 5 star possibility!

This place is right near where I work.  I had driven by it a few weeks ago and saw that the grand opening was near the end of January.  I decided that today was the day that I would try it out.  Me and my buddy Will from work hopped in my car and drove over here to sample some BBQ.  Plenty of parking outside and we walked in and there was nobody in line.  The place was packed though...all the seating was full.  Good sign!  The first thing I noticed was the little line/partition of wood.  Pretty cool set up and it also shows that this is true BBQ and its smoked low and slow with that same wood!  The place smelled great.  I surveyed the menu really quick and decided on a 2 meat plate.  I went with brisket and pulled pork, mac and cheese and cole slaw as my sides.  This also came with a little cornbread muffin.  They sliced up my brisket, scooped out my pork, boiled my macaroni and dished out my cole slaw.  They packaged it all up, paid and took it to go.  Here is how everything was...............

2 Meat Plate ($14.00)

Brisket-  They give you the option for chopped or sliced brisket.  I chose sliced.  There was not a fatty or lean option so I was not sure what was coming.  Thankfully it was a little mix of both.  It was fall apart tender, smoked proper and pretty delicious.  It was a decent sized portion of it too.  I was impressed.  Not the best I have ever had, but definitely up there and super legit.  No sauce needed.

Pulled Pork-  This was my second choice of meat.  It was seasoned well, moist and tasty.  No sauce needed for this stuff either.  The portion was just a tad skimp compared to the brisket, plus it was the last of it remaining in the container, so maybe it could have even been better?  It was darn good as is though...that has to say something, right?

Mac and Cheese-  When they lifted up the lid of the sides, I saw a vat of what looked like bright yellowish cheese.  It didn't look too appealing at first but then I saw some magic happen.  They actually make each order of mac and cheese on the spot and cook it to order.  They have some noodles in a colander, they boil those to cook them, then transfer them into the vat of cheese and coat them up.  This mac and cheese was legit!  The noodles were cooked perfectly and the cheese sauce they use was very good.  This is a definite must order side from here on out.  The portion was pretty large too.  I love the fact that they use textured spiral noodles too.  It lets the cheese stick to it pretty well! Overall, a great side.

Carolina Cole Slaw-  You have your choice of Carolina (vinegar) or Creamy (mayo) slaw.  I chose the Carolina style.  It was just ok.  It could have used more vinegar or apple cider or whatever they use.  It was kind of bland.  Not bad in any sense, just could have been more kicked up.  I would probably skip it next time and do double mac and cheese.  

Cornbread Muffin- Meh.  It wasn't that good.  It had chunks of corn in it which is not my style.  Tasted a little stale too.  Definitely wouldn't pay for one..it came with the plate though.

Overall, I was impressed!  For just over $15.00, you get probably 8-10 ounces of meat (at least) and 2 large sides.  The meat is legit, smoked,  REAL BBQ and the mac and cheese was really good.  I will definitely be back to try out some of their other meats like their ribs and sausage.  The fact that this place had no line at all around 12:20 was awesome too!  I'm sure that will change once word of mouth gets around on how good this place is, but until then, if you need to get some legit BBQ in Deer Valley, this is the spot.  As far as the Phoenix BBQ I have had, this place is way better than Pork on a Fork and just a tad under Little Miss BBQ.  Definitely can't complain though.  This place is legit!",4,2015-02-04 4:01

We had the buffalo chicken sandwich with a side of bacon mashed potatoes and the kale quinoa salad with chicken. Both amazing! I'll be back for ur chicken sandwich for sure. Taylor was our server and was a delight! Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the bottomless mimosas. Don't waste your money. The first one is delicious and the rest taste like pure orange juice. Supposedly they do half orange juice half champagne (we just watched the bartender make a carafe and it was 25% champagne) Oh, and it's only until 2pm.

The first concern I had from the beginning was the fact that there was only one person of Thai descent working and she was slinging the stuff they were selling. 

We open the menu to find reasonably priced fare (a soft spot for my wallet). Many of the dishes you would be accustomed to finding in any Thai restaurant could also be found on the menu here. Since it was my first visit to this establishment, I decided to go safe and ordered the Pad See Iew with Chicken. Once it arrived, I was pleased with the presentation. But in my many years of eating I have learned, just because it look good fo show don't mean it goin' da taste good!! To be fair it wasn't horrible... but I certainly have had better. 

The waitress could have been quite a bit more attentive. Something just seemed a little off about her? I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was that was off... but if I do, I'll let you know. Perhaps one thing could have been the fact that a table of 8 came into her section about 15 minutes after we arrived and we seemed to have been just forgotten. 

To sum it up folks... if you are in the area and you want a REAL Thai dish with plenty of kick hit up Thai Hut on McDowell and 1st St. Amazing food served by the people that invented the stuff, and prompt extremely attentive service.",2,2010-07-12 18:03

The food was subpar at best and the service was AWFUL. I honestly think there was something wrong with our waiter, he was extremely slow in more than one way and that's putting it nicely. First we were seated in a booth that was so small I felt claustrophobic, we asked to be seated at a table and that was fine. A few minutes later another couple were seated at that booth, she could barely fit, like her chest was actually resting on the table top and not by choice. We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Rogan Josh, we asked for both of them to be mild, they were both so spicy my husband couldn't eat it. Lastly, I was pleasantly surprised to hear they served Pellegrino, I was brought back down to earth when they brought it out warm and served it with ice. I never understand why restaurants do this. IT'S SPARKLING WATER, when warm and mixed with ice it turns flat almost immediately. All in all we had a horrible experience, unfortunately the owners have no idea how to run a business. I wanted to give them feedback about the Pellegrino as that's an easy fix, but by the time the meal was done we figured it would be pointless and we we're probably right.",2,2016-05-08 22:03

The hotel rooms were nice.  We got 2 queen beds in each room. I can tell you that the beds were not queen.  The blinds were awesome. They kept the room pitch black so we could sleep in.

My experience in three words: Crash and burn.

My experience in more detail:

Smokin Fins serves grilled meats, seafood, as well as salads, bowls, tacos and soup/stews. The restaurant itself is really large and has a contemporary warm feel to it. We were in the area and decided to dine here since it had been on my bookmarks list.

We started with the lobster tater tots. For close to $10 we got 4 thumb-sized breaded ""tots"" which were more like croquettes since it consisted of mainly mashed potato with a bit of shredded potato in the mix. I didn't really taste nor discern any lobster flavor nor see any noticeable lobster meat and it was really super salty for my tastes. 

For the entrees I went for the cioppino because you don't see it on menus very often and because it had the ""SF"" symbol meaning that it was a favorite. Not to be overly suspicious, but my first thought when I saw that symbol next to the price tag was, is it a self proclaimed ""favorite"" because it is the most expensive seafood menu item on the menu? I figured I'd roll the dice, take my chances and see if the cioppino lived up to its status!

I probably should have known better than to get a San Francisco signature dish in Arizona. When it came out I was initially really impressed with the presentation since they included a half portion of snow crab legs in the ""stew."" However, those thoughts soon went up in smoke as the entire dish itself was really disappointing. I'll even venture to say I really hated this dish. The plus was that there was a lot of variety in the cioppino: shrimp, clams, mussels, fish, and crab legs. However, the mussels were super tiny and the clams were not cleaned well at all. The sandy grittiness permeated throughout each clam and the more I ate the more the clams dispersed the grittiness into the surrounding stew, causing all the seafood to become gritty as well. You could say it tasted like the beach for I felt like I was eating tomato infused sand. One BIG no no was that they served me clams that were completely closed and could have been very dangerous to eat for anyone not in the know about seafood safety. The fish had bones in it and was served with the skin on. I don't enjoy eating rubbery fish skin if it's been put in a stew but that's my own preference. The crab legs themselves were so salty I couldn't actually taste the natural sweet flavor of the crab. The best seafood out of the whole mix were the shrimp but due to the sand in the dish they were gritty when I bit into them. 

I also really didn't like the actual stew the cioppino was in. Cioppino is normally more broth-like. This felt like I was eating a bunch of canned stewed tomatoes or eating a chunky marinara sauce.

The cioppino was served with 3 pieces of smoked grilled bread. I liked the smoke flavor but 2 of the 3 pieces were so charred on the outside that I was basically served burnt bread.

I had a bite of the honey chipotle salmon which I liked better, but had the same problem of being grilled for so long that it had an unpleasant bitter char on it. 

The only redeeming quality of my meal was the friendly service. 

After all that I was still hungry. I went to a nearby Chik-Fil-A right after my meal and felt more satisfied eating a grilled chicken sandwich for $5 lol. Quite honestly I probably would have gotten better food for cheaper at Red Lobster across the street (Burn!). 

The decor and service are nice, but it's all smoke and mirrors if the food isn't good!",2,2017-12-19 15:50

My colleagues decided to take me out for a birthday lunch a few weeks ago to a place I've never been before ... The Farm at South Mountain.  It was 5 of us in total and we all ordered different items.  Unfortunately I don't remember everything everyone ordered but I do remember items that stood out to me the most:
There was a special sandwich which features chicken, Granny Smith's apples, bacon, avocado and something else.  It was called the California Club or California Cobb I believe.  I did not get this sandwich but wish I had.  If you're at the Farm and it's on the menu do yourself a favor and order it.  I PROMISE you won't be disappointed.  The Tuna sandwich was also a winner in my book.  It tasted really fresh as if it was made to order.  I'm not sure if it was or not but it definitely taste like it.

I did not care of the side order of potato salad (too bland) and the spinach salad.  There was nothing spectacular about the spinach salad it all. We all also really enjoyed the Citrus Green Tea.  Be sure to a lot ample time for lunch because you'll wait a while for your lunch.  Not a problem when it's so fresh like that.

I'll can't wait to return to try some of the other sandwiches.",4,2018-05-10 17:59
S-rpJRWTZT3lJH4NuBtb2w,pib2mjzQWhLKpG3go6dNLQ,#NAME?,"There is only 1 reason to rate this place anything other than 1 star, and that is, their food. They do a very good job with making large, delicious meals. 

With that being said, they don't deserve anything more than 3 stars, at this point in time, because their service, wait time, and patio dining, are all subpar.

Service: After coming here 3 times now, I've had to wait 30+ minutes each time for my food to come out of the kitchen. Each time, I had to wait additionally after that for a set of silverware. 

Wait time: It seems that 30 - 40 minutes is typical on a Saturday or Sunday morning here, which is fine for a busy place, so I can't really blame them for. They're just busy.

Patio: It's November, and still fairly hot on their patio. It wouldn't be so much of a problem if they had shade coverings to keep their patrons cool. If you choose to move inside after something has opened up, you may be in jeopardy of losing your food, cause they have trouble keeping track of the table numbers and their patrons.

Overall, I'd still recommend a friend to give it a shot, because their food really is good. Each time I've been here, I leave with a full and satisfied belly. Just frustrated through the process of getting there.",3,2014-11-16 18:55
tdn3MQUcRw-dSviNCYsG6A,Wi0VgIrbb8vqU6weyVw6tg,r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA,"I gave DeFalco's another shot. At the end of this review, you will see the huge redeeming factor, and why this business has created a fan in me!

My dinner companion and I came in last night and we shared a plate of Gnocchi (with red sauce and alfredo, both on the side), as well as a Caprese Salad. We took home a chocolate cannoli.

We patiently waited for our meal, and we able to share a great conversation about some of the wonderful in the store like the different pastas, olive oils and such.

When our food arrived, we were treated to all kinds of good stuff! The Gnocchi was cooked to perfection. Not gummy, not tough...just perfect like little pillows of magic! The sauces were delightful! The alfredo is very rich and tasty. You can taste all the different ingredients in it. The garlic, the cheese, the cream. It's not the Olive Garden. It's legit! 

The marinara wasn't overly tangy or tomatoey. It was just right!

The Caprese Salad was perfect as well! The mozzarella danced on our palates and the tomatoes were divine. I would've liked a little bit more basil, but maybe that's something I can ask for next time :)

The portions are VERY generous. We were unable to finish the Gnocchi. You'll see why in a second.

Regarding my past review...The staff was much friendlier this time around. I am VERY happy that I gave these guys a second chance. Maybe I caught someone on a bad day. Things happen. 

Although there was a wait, we ordered before a few people because we were deciding on what to order. That's ok.  It was worth the wait. Take in the atmosphere, look around the store. Relax. Have a conversation with the person you are with. You'll forget about the wait. Don't be in a rush.

Also this time around, I was able to speak to Anthony DeFalco the owner, and talk to him about my first experience. He is a VERY nice guy, and very passionate about the business. My advice to any Yelper or customer who has ever had an experience that is out of the ordinary (most of the reviews are very positive), come in and tell him and he will make sure the staff fixes the problem for next time.

I should also mention that he saw me, and recognized me, and made sure that my table had a sandwich in addition to our meal that my dinner companion and I shared. It was PERFECT. Bread heavenly with a crispy crust, just enough mayo and mustard, delicious cheese, and tasty meats. 

I am a fan.

He then explained to me about his selection of ingredients, breads, olive oils etc. You can see the passion he brings to work each day. It's pretty cool. I don't usually update reviews from bad experiences, but this is one I am very glad I did.

Great job Anthony and the staff at DeFalco's!

P.S. We took the chocolate cannoli home. And it was epic.",5,2011-03-27 15:42

I called in an order at 11:10 AM for nine hamburgers nine orders of fries it took me 20 minutes for the person to reply that that was during the rush-hour and they could not process the order it was too large.  They could not work in an order for nine hamburgers to pick up at 11:45?   Could they have not just told me that the first place?  By the time they answered my question I stopped by the store and it was not even extremely busy.

SERVICE --
-- consistently poor, increasingly careless (used to be OK, now it's pathetic)
-- latest visit saw our steak overdone and crab cold
-- the service was inattentive at best, horrid at worst
-- server forgot to place an order for an appetizer (and then delivered the wrong appetizer)

FOOD --
-- food is consistently good, if served warm (last 2 visits, food was cold)
-- drinks are consistently good, if delivered promptly (which seldom happens)
-- food quality has drastically plummeted over the past 9 months

AMBIANCE:
-- pretty good
-- outside seating / patio seating is very nice
-- location is central

VERDICT:
-- unlikely to visit anytime soon
-- for a typical check of $110 or more (see photos), I would go elsewhere
-- save yourself time, money, hassle and headache and go to a myriad of different places in the area.
-- Have seen similar deterioration in service and food quality at other Fox restaurants in the area (looking at you, North and Olive + Ivy).",2,2015-10-26 18:32

I have eaten here tons of times and every experience with the food and service is the best ever.  I have had the Alfredo the Dark (fettuccine alfredo), the big beef sandwich, the big tuna sandwich, and now chicken wings and pizza.  The alfredo is so creamy and flavorful with a bit of spicy to it.  I remember not being able to finish the gigantic plate of noodles.  The beef sandwich makes my mouth water just thinking about it but my table was craving to share pizza and wings today so we ordered the pepperoni pizza thin crust and it was truly amazing.  The garlic was perfect the crust was and cheese were a great consolidation of flavor.  The chicken wings were great also, the sauce was a little thick and had a garlic hint to it as well.  Of coarse what would a visit to Oregano's without ordering a macadamia nut pazookie!  Man, this place is the best place for the cookie desert with ice cream, the half cooked cookie inside a good 10"" pan and about 1/2"" thick is so flavorful and good.  I almost got sick from eating to much.  Also if you have never been to an Oregano's be prepared to wait since they are always busy, the atmosphere is way casual and the decor is so very cool and trendy.

StewyMyC3lHpmcSZLlrBjQ,2gu5B_JbJlfZLhihSr-apQ,yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ,"So I have been here 3 times and I really wanted it to wow me each and every time but it simply doesn't.  First time I was with a friend and we were drinking more than eating so when my ridiculously expensive bill showed up I almost threw up all the $12.66 martinis I had drank.  Seriously?!?  The only place in town where I wouldn't freak on that price is AZ88 because one martini and you are almost done in.  Our server was friendly but I had to tell her to stop rushing us, she came back every 10 minutes or so wondering if we wanted our check.  I told her I would flag her down when needed but that we planned on being there a while.
Second time I went for lunch and everything was ok but not amazing.
Third time was last night and it will most likely be my last.  Every month 3 of my lady friends and myself try a new place, I actually was the one to suggest here. We started at the bar to have a cocktail while waiting for our whole party to arrive.  When it was time to move to a table our bartender asked us to close out our tab.  Didn't even offer to transfer it which is standard.  We ordered a started of cheese, roasted garlic, prosciutto, cornicons and oysters.  The little nugget of cheese we received was just that, a tiny little nugget.  Now I am a huge cheese snob, I have my very own travel bag from Venissimo Cheese shop in San Diego and every time I visit I come home with roughly $100 worth of cheese.  I know my cheese, I know the cost, I felt cheated that we each only got a nibble.  The oysters were good, not gritty at all, but there were a few staple accouterments that were missing, tabasco and crackers.  I ordered the beet salad which was middle of the road, but I did like that the beets didn't have a loamy taste.  One of my dining companions ordered the steak which was overcooked so she sent it back.  It came back better but with the same sides on the plate, they literally transferred what was on her original plate to the new one.  Terrible!  You don't let a plate sit under the heat lamp while you redo something, you make a whole new plate.  The worst part of the evening was after our appetizer our server informed us that it was almost 9 and the kitchen closes at 9.  WTF!?!  We are already seated, you know we are going to order dinner, there were at least 5 tables full in our section alone and you feel the need to rush our order?!?  Lame is a word that doesn't even do it justice.  To add the cherry on that lame sauce sundae, they kicked us out into the cold to wait for our ride!  It was freezing and all I had was a thin jacket WITHOUT gloves, I was shivering pretty bad by the time my fiance rolled up.  He was pissed that there were 4 women standing outside of the restaurant we just spent a pretty penny at and if there was a place to park he would have gone in himself to complain to the manager. (Thanks for looking out babe!)
I will finish this off with the positives, they had cocktail onions.  You wouldn't believe how hard it is to find cocktail onion served in this town.  Second their system for splitting checks is hands down amazing with us each getting charged 1/4 of the appetizer price.  I haven't seen that before.  Third the decor is nice.",2,2011-12-07 18:57

I feel like I say this in all my reviews lately but I'm pregnant and so really when I'm craving something, it's so specific and I end up building it up to be the best thing in the whole world and then when I get it I'm disappointed because my expectations were way unreasonable. Well today for lunch, I wanted Italian beef. I've had the cold Italian combo sandwich here before and a few other subs and they were always great. The artichoke salad is really good too. 

I ordered over the phone to avoid the lines... half Italian beef sub with provolone, and a side of Giardinara peppers. I went to pick it up and it was ready right away, and for everything it was only around $7. I read in another review that they don't dip the whole sub, and I like mine really juicy, but I figured I'd still try it. Well they provide a side of au jus so you can dip it yourself, so that was exciting. I got back to work and started eating... omg, it really was so so good. With each bite it tasted better and better. The hot peppers I got on the side made the sub though (I think that's what I was truly craving all along). It was hot and juicy and the au jus was more than enough. There was a lot of meat, which was tender and perfectly cut, not a singly fatty piece and it was all evenly distributed on the sub. Sometimes I have to rearrange my sandwich to even out the meat but this was perfect. It was so good. I was really full by the time I finished but still wished I had ordered a full. The only negative thing I would say is there were too many onions and green peppers for my taste. However, I'm not mad about that because I'd rather there be too many and I can pick some off rather than not have enough and wish there were more. 

The guy that always takes my phone orders is seriously the nicest guy ever. (I think his name is Joe?) He's so pleasant on the phone and just as nice in person.

Service was very friendly. They brought some sort of chips while waiting. I ordered Papa-K crepes for my breakfast simply because it was most reviewed dish. I really liked a little salt they put on the side. Not sure what kind salt it was, I tasted just salt by itself and thought it was good one.  Crepe was good but it didn't have that wow factor to it.

Eggstasy is a beautiful, modern restaurant that serves tasty food and a lot of it! My first visit I ordered the Greek omelette, which was a little odd, but yummy. Most plates can come with a side of pancakes, and there's the option to upgrade them to certain flavors! Because of the amount of food, I split the Steak and Eggs plate my second visit. It was just the right portion for us and cooked well. For the pancakes, we upgraded to raspberry white chocolate, which were very sweet but tasty. We also ordered the Eggasm (easy egg over potato purée). Potato over bread was a bit much for me, but the egg was cooked perfectly, and the presentation was beautiful. The menu is extensive, so I'm excited to go try something new here!",4,2018-06-10 17:54

The service is super slow and the place is very small. More for a date night then a large group. They do have nice patio space.

Some years I won't go for a year, another year, I would come a few times a week where the owner used to tell me ""see you tomorrow""....

I came here for lunch the other day this week and I was looking through the diner menu (as I always order only from dinner menu even during lunch time) as I came earlier than my friend.  I realized I ate everything on the menu. So am I a fan here? I must be. 

I like to come here with a group of people as I like to order as many dishes as possible.  I normally start with soup. Seafood soup is my favorite.  My favorite main dish includes rock cod with black bean sauce,  mapo tofu, green vegetables I can't remember the name but they know what I mean (they have pictures on the menu), singapore noodle, to name a few.

For dinner, I would like to ask them to cook fish (the whole fish), lobsters, and if we make reservation two weeks in advance, I would like to order Shaoxing wine (紹興酒). They don't normally keep a bottle but when we requested, they orddered bottles for us.  Warm shaoxing shu with sliced ginger goes well with the food they serve...

They also have special menu during Chinese New Years, as well as just sometimes. I learned how to say and read lot of dishes name in Chinese from this restaurant.  

Service may be on and off but quuality of food is always consistent. The most authentic Chinese food in North Phoenix.  How could I say that? Because I had Chinese food in China.",4,2015-04-16 22:51

I would have complained, but I had already waited far too long for my crepe to arrive, even though there were only a handful of customers in the place. So, since I was on my lunch break, I couldn't wait around for another crepe to be made.  Because I was running late, I asked for a to-go cup for my coffee, and was forced to grab my own, as the food runner didn't actually remember to bring me one.

It is definitely the service that has always been the problem. I don't know why. I've had a plate of bacon literally thrown down on the table at me with a nasty look. I've waited forever even after being seated. Things have been forgotten. But the food has always been good. It is pricey, but if they make it true to what they are supposed to do, there is a reason for it. I was an assistant manager at the one in IL. We made literally everything from scratch. We even melted a 25 lb chunk of butter to make our clarified butter to cook the pancakes on the griddle with. We ground our own corned beef and peeled the potatoes for the hash. The sour dough batter was made from a fermenting potato. The syrups were all homemade. I seriously mean every single thing was homemade. So all this does take time and quality ingredients to make which costs. With that being said, I learned how to make my own apple pancakes at home and we now have them every Sunday with thick sliced bacon and fresh squeezed orange juice for a fraction of what it would cost us to go to OPH.",3,2011-03-23 19:59

We came in on a Thursday around 740p for a party of 4 and already there's a 30mins wait. The area isn't that big so I get it. We did get seated in 20mins but took the server 10mins before she even came and took our order. 

I'm definitely not happy with the service, very slow took forever to get appetizers! A second server came to check on us finally but to tell us our ticket was dropped, but it's been put in now, omg this is crazy we literally sat here for 40mins before they even came to notify us or even check on us. 

Don't get me wrong the server was nice but I think if they would of checked on us they would of notice we sat here for now 49mins before our appetizer even got to the table. 20mins later no food and every one that came in after us already got their food, I would think if our ticket was dropped you would push our order up before the people that came in after us but instead they did their order first. The booth behind us even ordered a second round of appetizer and got it before we got our food. 

The cook and almost every server did come apologize for the wait but then I don't understand even after they found out we been waiting why did we wait even longer while everyone around us got their food. They gave us 20% off our bill which was cool but again they missed our order but didn't push it up.

The place is on a busy intersection but we found some parking spots in the back alley. It's cute with a lovely quote on the wall ""you are somebody to me"". Not too many folks inside when we came in so we surveyed the menu and thought about which flavors we'd like. I chose the coffee chocolate chip gelato with a dark chocolate drizzle, almonds, and waffle cone pieces. My brothers got the alphonso mango with a chocolate drizzle, peanuts and waffle cone pieces and the raspberry with a dark chocolate drizzle, Oreos and coconut. I really liked mine, the gelato had a noticeable coffee flavor and the almonds were a bit salty which helped to balance the sweetness of the rest of the pop. The gelato was interesting in that you could bite from it and chew it, rather than let it melt in your mouth creamy. The toppings were just right and there was enough left over to scoop with the wooden popsicle stick.   

While I was waiting for our pops, the young man at the counter suggested a diamond pop combination that he really enjoys. I appreciated his open and friendly demeanor and this place has good vibes. They have a lot of drinks and toppings to put in them so I'll be back sometime!",5,2018-03-24 22:39

KT9TMVLrATsRCxA2jXcS8Q,WMMI5Q4Rmm1Rqdu0jOvyhQ,UJb1PrUWDFfuzwUPc1pP4Q,"I can mostly understand the draw of El Hefe as a goto for ASU students.  Big expansive sports bar with a lengthy drink menu and friendly staff.  That said, eating here can feel like eating at Hooters (except with Mexican as the food theme).  Take that depiction however you wish, but I'm sure you can conjure up the appropriate (or inappropriate) imagery.  Regardless, I was invited here to hang out with some fellow Yelper buds during happy hour during a Thursday.  Fortunately we came just before the school year and thus didn't have to fight the ASU crowd.  Let's get to it.

Riot Hospitality Group is the brains behind El Hefe along with other valley restaurants such as Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row, Farm & Craft, and Hand Cut.  El Hefe's Tempe location lies right on Sixth Street just west of Mill on the southwest corner.  The restaurant can pack in somewhere between 100-150 people at full capacity with two fully stocked bars (one inside and one on the patio outside) and plenty of TVs at the bar, near the tables, and even above the urinals in the men's restroom (can't speak to the women's restroom for obvious reasons).  I can imagine this place jumping during the weekends when school is in session and especially on football game days.

As others have accurately pointed out, El Hefe does honor the free guac and chips check in offer (but beware only one per table).  So we got one of those to share.  The guac and salsas were fine, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Same goes for the chips.  For my main dish I was looking for something that might stand out above the usual Mexican fare that I would expect to find.  The Enchilada Blanco seemed like just such an intriguing complex dish.  Three enchiladas stuffed with pulled chicken and queso asadero.  The enchiladas are then topped with salsa roja, queso fresco, lime crema, and a white sauce I couldn't quite put my finger on.  Also came with a side of rice.  I was mostly happy with the enchiladas, though honestly I felt they could've put a little more chicken inside.  That said, I was pretty impressed with the different flavor combinations they integrated into this dish.  The rice on the other hand was super dry.  I'm guessing it was rice that cooked hours ago and sitting underneath a heat lamp.

To wash down the food, I got their house margarita which was discounted for happy hour.  I'd say the margarita was passable, but perhaps a little too sweet for my taste.  For dessert, I saw an item that had me written all over it.  I love horchata and I love milkshakes.  So naturally a Horchata Milkshake sounded magical.  I guess I didn't know what to expect it to look like so it was a little surprising when it came in a standard water glass, but the taste was unmistakably that of a milkshake blended with horchata (probably quite literally in a blender).  Tasty, smooth, and not too heavy.  Not a bad finisher.

Total cost for the entree, two drinks, tax and tip came to about $30.  As I write this, El Hefe fetches an average of 3 stars.  That's pretty much spot on based on my experience.  The food here is better than Hooters or Tilted Kilt based on my experience, though perhaps not as good as...say...Twin Peaks.  Measuring up El Hefe versus other valley Mexican restaurants doesn't really seem fair as they're not really trying that hard to be authentic to that degree.  But again, if you're in the ASU crowd and looking for a fun gathering space for a drink, this would be an attractive option.  As for the food, well, just don't expect anything in the same league as a Barrio Cafe or a Carolina's.",3,2017-08-11 6:10

Our visit lasted exactly 5 minutes.  That was long enough to have a seat at the bar and have the snobby bartender treat us like lepers for deigning to ask questions about the specials.  Judging by his terse and unhelpful answers, you're either in their little Happy Hour club and already have the options memorized, or you're out, so don't bother him.    I don't know if the bartender is trying to apply the Jehovah's Witness Heaven Limit to the number of people allowed to enjoy Fleming's Happy Hour, or if he was annoyed that he couldn't carry on an uninterrupted conversation with a coworker about scheduling work hours, or if he's just a knob, but we were interested in having a nice little time out, not cracking some bartender-induced secret code of Happy Hour enlightenment, so we got up and left.

I also like the spicy tuna rolls, Vegas rolls, krab rolls, philly rolls, and of course the Cali rolls and edamame.

The atmosphere is unique and reminds me of old mexico city, but with that comes dirty floors, flies, and gnats. Although the presentation of our food was beautiful, the quality of the food itself was a bit sketchy. The shrimp in the fajitas were over cooked and rubbery. The steak was also way over cooked and tough, and my chicken was very dry which is surprising since it was fajitas. Nonetheless, we endured our drinks through slow service and mediocre food just to later get sick that night and the following day. Which resulted in a ER visit and a day of lost work.

N8zQXnoA4QjBy5KG8RGyWw,X5T45QxyLjnuXohkvE3Rfw,oFHvr1cAktvU-bQgrl4aPw,"I hadn't been back to The Coronado since the menu change, so I decided to drop in for a couple of things. The quaint cafe-esque atmosphere was the same and I had a reason to knock out a rosemary chocolate chip cookie. (It was staring me down, so I showed it who was boss.)

I ordered:

- $9.00 Cauliflower Tacos which are masa-battered cauliflower florets on top of guacamole, chopped spinach, pepitas, and avocado dressing

- $11.00 Red Potato and Garbanzo Burger which is a potato and garbanzo bean patty accompanied with spinach and tomato/agave mustard on a buttermilk bun.

Well...let me start by saying TC does have interesting combinations, but the food is overkill. Can't fault them there, though, because no where does the restaurant claim to serve healthy food. 

My plates were tasty and comforting, but thinking of the quantities of oil consumed, it was less healthier than I prefer when eating out. I actually went home and ate a huge salad after that.

Here are my thoughts on how the dishes could be better:

I don't know why anyone would order the potato garbanzo burger with a side a fries. The patty by itself was delicious, soft, and falls apart easily. Unfortunately taste was overpowered by the thick starch-overloaded bun. The side salad I opted for was a pretty green arugula salad. It meant well, but the quantity was so small I could have easily used it as garnishment for the sandwich. Need more salad!

One thing annoyed me about the sandwich. The menu made no mention of mayo, but the cook spread mayo (vegan I presume - YUCK!) on the bun. So not only was the sandwich more oily on my tongue, it was slippery to bite into too. I wanted to slap the cook -- not for a good reason.

For anyone that doesn't like thick buns, I suggest asking if they would substitute a wrap or pita pocket. Even a lettuce wrap would be much better than that thick buttermilk thing. 
 
As for the cauliflower tacos, once again the delivery was over done. Masa breading AND corn tortilla? Come on. The fried masa is oily and once it's cold it falls off into the guacamole (naturally oil rich). The tacos would taste much better with roasted cauliflower. 

But anyway, I'm not a cook. I just eat.
Three stars for the food this time around.",3,2017-07-09 20:23

Our bill for a bottle of wine, an appetizer, and two pizzas was $88.  $22 apiece and we all left full and happy.

I would definitely recommend the ""Artichoke Heaven"" or ""TMI Toast"" as a starter.  Any sandwich you pick should not disappoint, my favorite's are ""The Sheridan"" and the ""RB & C.""  I would recommend the greens as your side, the dressing is delicious.

Regardless, I decided to try Jewel's for breakfast after seeing a friend post a super tasty looking photo of their food. I was also excited that they use many local providers for their ingredients. I had their egg sandwich with the egg cooked over medium (which they weren't sure they could do, but did end up doing). The husband had the biscuits and gravy. The sandwich was.... lackluster. They forgot to put the cheese on it, and when I asked for the cheese, they gave me a cold slice... not exactly the same as having melted cheese on a breakfast sandwich. The sausage on the sandwich was mediocre and the bread was dense... heavy... unpleasant to eat. The sandwich could have benefited from A) different bread or even a wrap or tortilla and B) some vegetables.... who wants to get a sandwich that just has meat and egg on it? It needed something fresh. The biscuits and gravy were the same story.... dense heavy biscuits with mediocre gravy. So why 3 stars? I got their chocolate chip cookie with check in.... I was worried it wasn't going to be great given the meal.... I was SO wrong... this was one of the best cookies of my life! The cookie had to be about 80% chocolate to 20% cookie.... it was so good.

We're blessed to have a lot of really good Mexican fare available to us in the area, but this doesn't make that distinction (in my humble opinion.) We decided to stop in after going to the movies and when I checked in on Yelp, there was a special deal $10 for $20 worth of food - why not? We ordered traditional margaritas (a bit too sweet). For entrees: Jefe Pollo and two tacos (pork & chicken). The cole slaw that came with the chicken was good, and the piece of chicken was large, but unfortunately, overcooked. The black bean salsa was flavorful, too. The tacos were so-so. Not bad, not good.

When we got our bill, the waitress had not included the Yelp deal so had to re-do it. 

I think this place has a bit of identity crisis. The bar area was like a sports bar which didn't seem to fit with the restaurant theme. And can someone explain the 3 aquariums on the wall dividing the bar from the restaurant? First of all, either the (plexi)glass is very scratched, or the water is dirty. Not attractive or appealing. One tank had a bunch of teeny fish, and I saw one fish in another tank, but one tank looked empty - maybe the fish were hiding. But at first glance, these look like 3 tanks with fake coral in them. I just don't get why they are there - doesn't seem to fit with the whole Mexican food - agave theme.

#NAME?,4UgCYM-rbqzukAJyAU_95Q,YmOWkved7K8q3eXgf4NNnA,"NCounter is located on the North end of Mill Ave, near the PHX Metro Light Rail track.  As much as I hate going out to eat on Mill Ave, due to the stressful moments I have trying to find parking, this place is definitely worth it.

The restaurant has a modern industrial feel to it, as the color scheme is black, white, and gray with orange accents. It's very trendy and has a ""underground hipster"" feel to it.  Very appropriate for its college town location.  They have a large patio section surrounded by trees which makes brunch on a February afternoon seem like you're relaxing in paradise. 

Service there is very laid back.  You place your order at the front counter, you're given a letter (N.C.O.U.N.T.E.R. which I thought was pretty clever) to bring to your table as you wait for a server to deliver your food.  You serve your own drinks and retrieve any extra napkins or utensils you may need for your meal.  Seating is all first come first serve based, and the restaurant is even dog friendly.  I was really excited to see a cute Shitzu getting tangled up under a neighboring table. 

The only thing that I didn't like was the line formation when ordering.  Tables and chairs are set up down the center of the restaurant in an angular position and you are forced to maneuver your way around other guests as you walk to the back counter to place your order.  Even there, space is limited; which results in you waiting in line- standing a foot away from customers trying to enjoy their meal. 

Once in line, I was struggling with deciding on an meal.  There is so much variety to choose from.  I got to the counter expecting to see only breakfast items (waffles, pancakes, omelettes, etc) but they also offer a selection of soups, salads, and sandwiches.

For the most part, NCounter is a great spot to visit for brunch if you're in the Tempe area.  I really enjoyed the ambiance and the quick service.  It's probably not something that I would necessarily make the trip for if I wasn't living in the area- but that also comes hand in hand with the fact that I hate parking on Mill. :)",4,2013-08-08 21:24

Co-worker had told me how delicious, moist & tasty the food was when he had it at a wedding-sadly I was let down. Ordered the BBQ Sampler-Deluxe (pulled chicken, pulled pork & brisket). The pulled chicken was dark meat & very tasty to my surprise. The brisket & pulled pork both was dry & bland. With all the meat a dinner roll would have been nice, but no. Baked beans were yummy & peppery. Mac&Cheese was a bit grainy. Workers were really nice, but a bit slow for the lunch time crowd.",3,2016-03-21 19:41

I've been here for happy hour before and sat at the bar and it was pretty good so thought it would be nice to try a meal at some point too. So we made a reservation for today, were seated in one of the large booths towards the back of the dining area close to the restrooms. I didn't think anything of the location of the table at the time, but towards the end of our experience realized that it can't be easy to check on the tables back there without actually walking over there. Which no matter what, the server should be keeping a good eye on the tables he or she is taking care of. 

That said we took our time ordering our food. We ordered Lavender Mochas which came out first and were very delicious. It then took a while for the server to come back for our food order which finally we were like hmmm is this person ever coming back? The place was pretty busy, but not overloaded to where they couldn't handle quality service. We'd been there over an hour at this point which wasn't too bad as we were all busy chatting. Anyways we finally order. I got the chicken sandwich. Another 45+ minutes goes by where finally we're like hmmm what happened to our food? Finally it comes and one of the managers expressed a brief apology about a back up and mishap in the kitchen. Okay, no big deal since we have our food now. Well sadly the bottom bun on my sandwich was soggy so it must have been sitting for a bit of time in the kitchen area to become that soggy. Too hungry at this point to say anything or send it back, I just dealt with it. 

Once we finished we didn't see our server until she swiftly comes by asking if we need any boxes. Took a while to finally get the one box we asked for, but the server disappears for a long period of time once again. Finally we had to wave down someone, anyone to get our server to close us out. What we hoped would be a casual Sunday lunch catching up with some girlfriends ended up being a bit of a let down in terms of the restaurant experience and service. I want this place to succeed, but I think there is some lack of attentiveness with some of the staff - or something, but I probably won't be going back here anytime soon. I'm not even in the neighborhood and made a trip from downtown Phoenix to try it out. 

Hopefully some significant changes can be made because I'm impressed with the ratings on Yelp for this place! Hopefully something was just off and we had bad timing in coming in today. We didn't even have mimosas or cocktails either!!!",2,2018-02-26 0:02

The price is good ($4 for a nice big cup) and the coffee was the best tasting I have had in ages! Wish I lived closer, I would be going here all the time!

I liked their shops. Lots of fun items. I liked the produce stand. The man working there offered to hold my bags in a fridge while I went to eat. He was very helpful. 

The restaurant was not worth the wait. We waited well over and hour for a party of 2. Once seated, our table tilted when leaned on because it wasn't level, there were a ridiculous amount of flies, and little bits from the tree repeatedly fell into our drinks and food. 

The food was pretty good. It tasted very fresh, but a bit bland. The prices were really high.",3,2014-11-16 14:51

Ranch House Grille is a family home breakfast/lunch eatery that serves up Southwestern-style comfort food. It's in a nice location with a great shaded patio area. I found the staff warm and welcoming. The food wasn't bad (about 4 out of 5) and the portion sizes were great. I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs and enjoyed a quiet morning here.

Beef brisket was tough, shredded chicken was a tad too dry and the pulled pork was ok. Ended throwing away the brisket! The corn bread was so small it shouldn't be considered a side!  It was just meat and 2 sides and they don't even give you bread or roll.  In Texas where I came from, BBQ there is so much better and they give you all the hot rolls you want!!  Since moving back to Phoenix we had tried other BBQ places here and they were better!

Well tried this place one more time 5-1 -17. Most likely will never come back! Had their pulled pork sandwich and the bun was very stale and hard! Pulled pork was terrible and had so many hard pieces in it. Had a side salad and it just came with lettuce and a couple of cherry tomatoes with ranch dressing that tasted like it was old!

If you speed by North 2nd Avenue and West Roosevelt Street in Downtown Phoenix, not only will you get a speeding ticket but you will definitely miss out on one of the hole in the wall restaurants in Phoenix. 

I tried their Herb Crusted Rack of Lamb, which came with the Chorizo and Manchego Risotto, and it was to die for. My wife was not a wine drinker but had their sweet red wine (forgot the name but found in AJ's Food Market on Central/Camelback) and she wanted the some for her next house party. The other dishes we had were the Spinach, Brie, & Grapes, Blackberry Spinach Salad, White Truffle Pizza and Meatballs Marsala. My mouth and tummy was very happy that night...Thank you Centurion!!!

Great customer service and place was very small. Definitely need to set a reservation ahead of time before coming here. BUT! NEWS FLASH! Our waitress stated they were going to extend the place and will occupy the business space to their west (unknown when they will begin this project).

Another great location for a date night and would also recommend it to visitors, family and friends. Definitely a MUST VISIT!",5,2012-07-20 22:56

The best thing about Oregano's is the Bellini's and the staff. The food is pretty good and is a good value. Usually order the Pablo Picaso Salad (amazing) and the Alfredo the Dark Pasta with Shredded Chicken. The toasted Ravioli apps are yummy. This place is always busy, so expect a wait even during the week. The best time to come is after 9pm in my opinion. I have seen the wait as long as two hours, no joke. They don't take reservations and all the party has to be there for them to list you. Choose inside, outside or first available. You can order a drink and even apps for the wait. This is basically a bar that sells food so leave the kiddos at home. They will not enjoy it here, you will not enjoy it here with them and everyone else will not enjoy it so take them to McDonalds and leave them with a sitter. You deserve a night out anyway.

The Pizza Cookie is really good. I like Chocolate Chip/Peanut Butter. The servers here really work their buts off. They will do most anything to make your meal here a great one. They even chit chat with you if you like and make you feel special. I never tip under 20% here and feel I get my money's worth every time. 

They seem to have been turning over help more in the past couple of years. They have a solid business and I attribute that to their growth, but for the most part the employees seem to like working there.

My only real beef aside from the wait is there are only two bathrooms. One Male and one Female. As many customers as this place has they need to figure a way to add dividers and make it so more can use as there is always a line. The parking is not a big deal to me. They have a small lot, but there is PLENTY of street parking nearby and if there is not, then you need to come back at a different time because the wait will be a killer.",5,2010-05-24 3:47

The restaurant was clean, but not much in decor. As I entered, a fish tank with a variety of fish greeted me. More interesting were the tanks on the back wall. One was empty. Crabs were in one, lobsters in another, and healthy looking fish in the third. Seasonal prices are by the pound, not per item. A 2 1/2 pound at $16 and change is going to run just over $40. As lively as they look, I just might splurge!
Some other reviews have commented on poor service.  This was not my experience at all. Both the waiter and waitress were attentive, efficient, and polite. He checked back to make sure I had everything I needed. I was very satisfied.
Their menu is extensive and reasonably priced.  This also applies to the lunch menu which includes your choice of soup (sweet/sour), an egg roll, rice (white or fried), and your entree. As I like seafood, I chose shrimp and eggplant Szechuan style (see pic).
It had a chili pepper by it indicating the dish was hot. My only complaint is the dish was too mild to deserve that chili. However, it was very flavorful. The hot and sour soup was solid, but not extraordinary.

PJ packs the best food for dollar quality and quantity I know of in Phoenix.  Not only is it a great place with a lot of options, but it is inexpensive.  We ate there today and shared the hummus, got a cup of soup and the thousand bean hot pita and an iced tea at it was only $18.  That is great for any sit down, but even a better deal because the food is awesome.

The Hummus is great.  Two tips - 1. ask for a mix of all 3 flavors (same price and you get a chance to try all three) and 2. Ask for an extra pita (no extra cost) - not sure why you only get one to start since you can barely finish the plate with 2 pitas.

If you are in the mood for soup, I recommend the red lentil soup.  It is thick and go with the cup of soup vs. the bowl.  The cup is about as big as a full bowl anywhere else.  The soup has just the right texture and full of flavor and my wife simply calls it ""goodness.""

Salads are always a great choice and don't worry, you get a plate overflowing with food, too.  I also go with the Thousand Bean Hot Pita.  I seriously think it comes with a full 1000 beans over a bread of brown rice on a pita - very good and half the plate will fill you up.  

The only downer is that the place is pretty small and the parking lot is shared by other busy places, so at lunch you have to be a parking lot stalker to find a seat.

The Manger apologized and said the server had never seen that type of ID before. I have a federally legal ID (not the new white one)  and it looked the same as everyone else at the table, and I'm sure the same as everyone else at the bar. Then continuing on, my boyfriend and I ordered some sliders. After about 20 mins we asked the waitress to check on them, she said they would be right out. 10 more minutes we asked her again, she apologized and said they would be right out. After about 15 mins more, and her never coming back we flag down the manager to check on our sliders. She apologized, said the ticket must have been misplaced in the kitchen and they would put a rush on it (which is fine, but don't lie and say it's coming out right now). About 20 later we flag the Manger again and tell her to cancel the order of its not ready  as we are just ready to leave. She apologizes and says they are plating it right now. About 10 minutes later we tell her again to just cancel the order. She again says they are boxing it right now. We'll tell her to just get our tab for our drinks  so we can just leave, after like an hour we don't want the sliders anymore. Finally another 10 minutes later she brings our boxed up sliders which didn't even end up being good. They did end up coming our ticket (which really would have only been about 15 bucks)  but the situation was still very poorly handled.. Don't lie and act like it's done and in the window if they haven't even started it yet.",1,2015-10-28 3:42
eR2Po7ZLjvHevGmfGX4ATA,xfC2SpdOyw_SjcvjMKTCFQ,-4TMQnQJW1yd6NqGRDvAeA,I just want to say again that I had another exquisite visit to The House. I was invited to a bridal shower on December 29th. The patio could not have been more comfortable or inviting. It truly felt like we were at someone's home. I was so AMAZED at how much I enjoyed the food! I was still so stuffed as I tried to taste more of the shared pork dish (only on Sundays) and it's accompaniments. The service was stellar.

Normally, it's annoying when a waitress asks me how I'm doing every 5 minutes, but she was not just trying to earn an extra buck. She was genuinely concerned.

The missing star is because of the style (or lack there is) in the music I heard there. The waitress said it was the bartender's iPod mix. Anyway, I'd bet that they normally play better music.",4,2015-06-23 9:25

Monday's are pretty bustling for the $3 burger plate and wine specials. It's chaotic but well worth the madness considering the deal. The wingless buffalo dip is one of my favorite plates and we've even been able to duplicate the recipe for a few of our own house parties. Another highlight is Maizie's Sunday Brunch. The red chili is awesome and so are $3 Mimosas & Bloody Mary's. We recently tried the Tuesday Fish Fry which was also great. Plenty of fried fish, a hefty serving of fries, two hush puppies and a creamy corn tartar sauce. The Half Baked dessert (warm cookie with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream) is the perfect ending to any meal and enough to share with at least two others. 

Additional high marks go for location (walking distance from the Central & Camelback light rail stop), patio seating (especially this time of year), wine punch card club (buy 5 glasses and your 6th is free. SCORE!) and the beer and wine selection. Service on a normal night is always great. Not so easy breezy on Monday nights or during the mad rush for Sunday Brunch.

Happy hour til 7 seemed decent but we were too late. My friend had the meatball sub and it was the best one I've tasted. We got it with sub bread and it was perfect. They also have several other bread options (sesame, crunchy baguette, etc).  The linguine (pasta options are spaghetti, linguine, fettuccine, and penne) was a bit mushy but I liked the basic marinara sauce - it had some heat with lots of red pepper flakes. The sausage was bland - I would go for the big, fluffy meatballs. The garlic bread had a lot of herbs but was also surprisingly bland. This place is inexpensive and laid back - it has a family owned feel that I like. Everything has a lot of options as I mentioned above, and you can do half or whole orders (half was plenty for me). There is a soda fountain and free refills.

I love the open kitchen concept where you can see all the fresh ingredients and amazing food they are putting out.

$15 for unlimited champagne during brunch, extra $2 to add a glass of OJ which lasted about 3 refills. I also got a lemonade which was fresh squeezed and the best I have ever had! So refreshing and would make a great summer cocktail. The food menu was great with a ton of options. I got the grilled cheese melt with tomato soup. It was very good and the perfect portion. The soup was pretty simple but paired well with the amazing grilled cheese filled with crisp bacon!! My friend got the roasted pulled chicken sandwich which was huge and looked incredible. She enjoyed it as well! We ended the meal with the apple berry crastada dessert which was light and had the perfect amount of sweetness.

The menu is filled with rice bowls, fried rice, burritos, quesadillas, combo's and snickerdoodles- yum!  You actually get a few snickerdoodles with your meal, which is a nice touch, I think. 

And if you're a vegetarian, you don't have to worry that you'll be stuck eating white rice and that's it.

This review is for drinks (smoothies, milk teas) only, as I haven't tried the ice cream bars. The drinks veer on the sweet side, and prices are on the high side as well.  

Avocado All the Way smoothie:
The first time I got this drink, I thought it was a solid 3stars because the avocado was creamy and fresh, the staff accommodated my request of less sweetness and just condensed milk, and it was a pretty good size. There were chunks of ice that hadn't been blended very smoothly, but it's a smoothie -- it happens. The second time I got this drink, the avocado was unripe to the point of being crunchy. This meant that it separated from the ice and condensed milk almost immediately, there were hard chunks that hadn't been blended because of how crunchy it was, and I even found a sliver of the outside skin in the drink. And raw avocado has that weird habit of coating the inside of my mouth with that friction-y, somewhat bitter aftertaste. For $5+, I wasn't impressed and ended up throwing away the drink after a few sips.

Malibu's Most Wanted smoothie:
Pretty good rendition of a pina colada, and pretty creative with the presentation as well. If I liked pina coladas, I'd probably get this more often as it's a nice virgin version (try saying that five times fast). And yes, the creative drink names are pretty darn cute.

Milk teas and teas:
The teas here are unfortunately a far cry from Dayung's, and they're pretty watered down and generally taste like sugar water. Not bad if you're a fan of that kind of ""milk tea,"" but it feels more like milk and sugar with a little bit of tea rather than tea with milk and sugar. The Thai tea is overly sweet, but the tea taste was stronger. 

Overall I'm not sure if I'd come back. It's such a cute little spot, but with the prices and misses, I'm not sure I'd venture back to pay for the ambiance instead of the products.",2,2018-07-19 5:07

Margs are never even my go to, but at 4 bucks a pop for a delightfully strong house margarita, how could I say no? Also on HH: half priced apps and $2.50 tinga tacos. 

You can't really go wrong with any of their tacos, at least in my experience. Shredded beef and carne asada both excellent, and the island shrimp is a bit of a sleeper hit. But I always come crawling back to the tinga. God, it's just fantastic, especially on the hard shells--I'm not usually a hard-shelled taco kinda gal, but these are the perfect amount of crispy fried perfection. 

My one small gripe about Cien is that while the food is all amazing, it's pretty hard to get in and out in a tight hour during lunch time. What we've ended up doing in the past is ordering, and then asking for our checks as our food comes out so we can bounce ASAP. Not the hugest deal, just a bit of a hassle gettin' back to that 9-5.

I would come back just to sit on the patio sipping drinks and observing a local species known as the Douchebagus Scottsdaleus in its natural habitat. The Douchebagus is a nocturnal creature that  typically travels in packs of three to eight and flourishes in the area engaging in a complex mating ritual that includes consuming copious amounts of alcohol and behaving in an increasingly obnoxious and self-absorbed manner until it attracts an equally obnoxious and self-absorbed mate.  The patio at Kelly's offers front row seating as packs of Douchebagi roam the streets, though this does detract from the classy touched afforded by the gas lamps.

Beyond the front row entertainment, I was happy with the bruschetta and cheese plate and the Jameson girls were there so I enjoyed more than a few Jamey and Gingers (Jameson and Ginger Ale) on special for $4. For dessert I had a greyhound so the amateur-professional alcoholic in me could not have been happier.

Laura was not thrilled about her steak sandwich and made it a mission not to let me order food (did I eat at all that night? I really can't remember) and some of the other people in our group repeatedly had to send back their drinks. The margarita ""tasted like lime juice"" if I recall. But I continued to happily down my Jamey and Gingers. So much that we eventually decided to move on.

I think we did the right thing by starting here then moving on to drunker pastures.",3,2012-10-18 6:31

Being from out of town, I was using yelp to find some sushi close to my hotel. After seeing the high rating, my friend and I decided to walk over. We saw that it was busy but not full so we had hope. 

Even though there was at least 4 open tables (5 including a reserved one), they were not seating anyone that had been waiting. The tables themselves hadn't been bussed yet. So patiently we wait, 25 minutes go by and they still aren't bussed and the line continues to grow. Being near the front, we decided to continue waiting. 

35 mins hit and we are seated along the front window. The table was still dirty... Another 10 goes by and we finally order our drinks. 10 mins later they arrive and we place our order. 20 mins later and that arrives. I order their pot stickers and they were tasty. I also got some tuna nigiri which was COVERED in this spicy bitter sauce. Yuck. Lastly I got spicy tuna rolls which were poorly put together and extremely loose. My friend got the Vegas roll which also were poorly constructed and covered in a spicy mayo. They also only tasted like pure jalapeño. They went unfinished. 

Also, the service was abysmal. I finished my water and never got to have it refilled in the hour and half long meal. My friend waited 25 mins to get a refill on a coke. Ugh. While busy, they didn't look short staffed or over filled. We saw them standing by the front a lot. 

All in all, I will never go back.",2,2015-05-31 3:33

The restaurant is small, so get there early or go on a weekend for lunch if you don't want to wait for a table... however, my motto: if there is a line or a wait, it must be good!... and it was! 
Our waiter was very friendly and so were all the sushi chefs. My hubby asked for a specific roll and they made it for him on the spot! The sushi is all really fresh and they make a bunch of different rolls and other things as well. It was a fun time and I can't wait to go back!

 Excellent beer selection and they stock some of my fav Belgian brews. Happy happy joy joy. They have my fav gin and that makes me grin. Good selection of other drinks too but having said that they could use a greater variety of single malts but it's not bad either 

The mix drinks are always the bomb and I love me some Moscow mule esp in this damn weather. Craig makes you a solid stiff drink and doesn't down it under ice. More happiness 


The food selection is lacking and rather abysmal but it's not like the place markets itself as a restaurant.  Even so, it would be nice to have more on the menu than their pizza offerings which are all pretty darn good. 

The place is clean the restrooms are spotless and for a bar that's pretty darn impressive. 

The atmosphere is very laid back the patrons are just as friendly as the staff and honestly for a local bar that is just unbeatable.

Diego Pops does have a very nice presentation going for it and I did like the decor. For lunch I decided on the cheese quesadilla and the shrimp taco. The cheese quesadilla was better than expected and I loved the presentation that it came in! As for the shrimp taco it was decent but nothing too special as far as tacos go.

Service was a bit of a letdown however as once the restaurant got more busy it took a while to finish up my meal and get the check. Perhaps they were short staffed or just wasn't expecting so many people to show up but it wasn't too big of a deal.

Overall I would say that Diego Pops is a nice addition to the area but with the service being a bit of a letdown due to the slowness that I experienced at the end of my meal I would probably think twice about coming back here again.

Chef and owner Tottie Kaya, along with her husband have been tirelessly working on the expansion for months unbeknownst to the ordinary diner.

The renovations include warm orange and red colored walls along with specially designed furniture and a gorgeous suspended crystal sculpture.  The cuisine has expanded as well.

BmcCSWbAkDk6PnWe49luNA,fv2dTpkYO7O0Ct8z7pmsdg,Xg5qEQiB-7L6kGJ5F4K3bQ,"WOW!!! This was the best brisket I have ever had!!!! This place knows how to make/smoke their meat. I had the pulled pork, the fatty brisket, and a buddy was nice enough to let me try some of his turkey as well. All of the meats here at TOP KNOTCH! The owner and his dad were super nice, and awesome people in general. 

All that being said, there are several reasons why I think this is a four star place rather then a five star.
 
First of all it is just over priced. The sides are nothing special, and the beans had more kick to them then I was looking for. 

Second, the place is super small! 90% of the seating is outside and even with the misters, you can't ignore the fact that it is 105 degrees outside. No matter how good the food is, it doesn't taste as good as it could when you are uncomfortable. 

Third, there are no fountain  drinks or fresh brewed iced tea. How can you have a BBQ place with out fresh ice tea? Answesr: it can't be done right. All there drinks are in cans or bottles. This is kind of related to problem number one with the overall price. You end up paying a $1.50 for a .25 cent can of soda.

Last but not least, and the thing that may have upset me the most is the system to get in. This is a place that once they sell out they are closed. They use a line system like the rest of the world but the line does not matter. Several groups set one person early to get in line, then had random people show up and cut in line as we continued to actually get pushed to the back of the line. 

Look, I don't care if your friend is in front, you get your butt to the back of the line. We had a group of 8 that was split into 3 groups because that was the order we got there. That is how a line works! When you show up, you go to the back! If I did not have people there telling me to calm down it would have come to blows! 

I was there 10 minutes before it opened and because of cutters it took me 35 minutes after it opened to even place my order. There is just no accountability for doing the right thing anymore. 

The food was so good that I will go back, however next time I will get there 30 minutes before it opens, and just start inviting random people who just showed up to cut in front of you.",4,2014-09-13 10:57

The part that makes this place truly special from a human touch perspective is the owner personally greets, mingles, and answers questions from the never ending line of patrons.  Remember when all the meat for the day is gone they shut it down.

Not only is this place very easy on the wallet, it's so interesting!  In addition to being a deli it is also a small Italian grocery with numerous wines, oils, cheeses, and meats.

As sometimes I do, I did a little research on the menu and I knew exactly what I wanted to try. The Santa Fe Eggs Benedict, eggs poached lying on top of cured ham with jalapeno corn bread below it and a yellow chipotle hollandaise sauce covering the dish, I also switched out the rosemary potatoes for the sweet potato hash, visually this dish looked freaking fantastic, however everything was lacking in flavor and my poached eggs I think came from a mini hen, barely any egg whites and small yokes,  the ham was good, had great flavor, I had high hopes for the jalapeno corn bread, taste buds were expecting to be hit with bits of jalapenos sadly that didn't happen, just seemed like dry corn bread, oh and the hollandaise sauce, have I told yall how much I love hollandaise sauce, oh high hopes for the sauce too, because cilantro, it has its own unique taste and smell and I just love the stuff, I love how it can go from a spicy dish to a sweet dish and add great flavor to what was already perfect! But the hollandaise sauce didn't have the hint of cilantro, and the sauce itself was lacking flavor, so I will continue my search for the great hollandaise sauce in the valley.  The sweet potato hash, ok I had no idea what to expect on this, it was bland like it needed some salt and pepper, but it was fresh, it had mushrooms, zucchini? and onions sautéed  mixed in with  slices of sweet potatoes, never thought of doing a sweet potato like that, now I know, going to have to try it at home! 

I ordered the cinnamon roll too, just to try it, again visually great, but the roll was dry and hard and inedible but the icing was perfect. 

Service seemed to be ok, for some tables they were on it and others it was eh, maybe they could work on that too.

Chino Bandido Takee-Outee is the taste of my youth, the one redeeming restaurant in the entire Moon Valley area and surrounding.

It is an ethnic flavor explosion. 

Don't be afraid of the ordering process, they are there to help you through it the first time (and they let you try the most popular dishes!). After that, it's a cinch. The price is right, too, but it really is a hole in the wall. Don't fight it, embrace the dive-y nature.

My only complaint: When I stopped eating meat, I stopped coming to Chino; if you're not carnivorous, the options are pretty limited (the chile relleno is much too greasy for me, the veggie enchilada is a bit al dente).

We like the place that much.  We went again today and ordered the mussels, which always make me blaspheme with pleasure they are so good.  They are on par with fresh mussels I've had on the coasts.  Just amazing.  And the broth is bacony and oniony and peppery.  They give you one slice of very good garlic bread per order, which is really not enough.  That order should come with two pieces so I don't have to pay a buck for another one or start dipping things like french fries and tacos in that wonderful broth.  One of these days I'm going to ask Kevin to hook me up with a dirty martini with about a 1/2 shot of that broth.

We typically get the fish and chips, which have always been perfect, but today for some reason I tried something different.  I had the pork tacos app for my meal and it came with four fat stuffed little soft shells with some tasty tomatillo salsa and pico de gallo.  Tender pork and flavorful salsa.  My belly was very happy.  I topped that with a Newcastle, and then was feeling frisky so I asked Kevin for one of those Three Olives Froot Loop drinks.  Great dessert.  Trust me.  The Baileys Bread and Butter Pudding is a stellar dessert choice as well.  

Mr. M had the cod sandwich and it was fried perfectly, as the fish always has been there.  It may seem simple to some, but there's really an art to cooking fish.  It doesn't take much to overcook it and whoever is frying it up back in Fibber's kitchen knows what they are doing.   I don't usually eat a lot of fries but theirs are like crack for me because they are skinny and brown and salty.  Mmmmmm mmm mmm.  And I will say a few of them got dipped in that mussels broth and that was delicious. 

So my only simple request, with eyes wide open like Puss In Boots in the Shrek movies, is to add a second piece of garlic bread to the mussels order.  Maybe do only one when it's half off during happy hour, but faith n' begorrah, one just isn't enough!!",5,2012-09-16 3:50

I ended up trying the macarons -- orange, strawberry and mocha? The orange was the best -- it had a unique flavor, perfect amount of tart, definitely hit the spot for me. But the other flavors were ok, nothing special about them, definitely had better. I was hoping they'd be more chewy.

But I had a pot sticker craving so I ordered a few items that seemed decent per reviews.

The guy said 15-20min but it took 40 minutes.

The pot stickers (which I got pan fried vs steamed) were actually more like deep fried.  The sauce is more sweet, not vinegary.  Not terrible but out of 6 there was about 2 that had a decent amount of filling, the rest had about a tablespoonful in a dumpling that is about 4 inches long and 3 inches tall.  The taste of the filling and the dumpling dough was good, just poor proportions and a bit greasy.

The sweet and sour chicken was bright pink and more onion than anything else.  Overall somehow the dish was bland.  The rice that came with it was soggy - too much water. 

The pad see ew noodles were overcooked and clumped up into small cubed bits.  The flavor wasn't bad, but overcooked noodles really ruins a noodle dish.

Judging as these entrees that had decent ratings were not very good I don't think I'll be returning.",2,2013-08-08 4:46

Last night was my last straw. We placed an order over the phone at 5:30, it was supposed to take 30 minutes. We went to pick it up, stood around waiting for 25 minutes while staff completely ignored me, didn't seem to have a clue what was going on - then they tried to give me my food that had been sitting ready for 20 minutes.

My last visit was not my normal experience with them. They were busy and there were about 10 of us however, the server was quite rude. There was one girl in our group that didn't eat because the server gave her attitude and she decided she didn't want anything that the server was going to bring her.  

The server also refused to split checks for us even though we told her at the begining we were on seperate tabs. When the bill came most of us were paying with debit cards so it was a little nightmare.

I am totally open to try everything and anything. So...I Did.
I was debating on the 3-4 stars because mostly of the naan bread!
Holy jeebus....that Naan bread and rice pudding and the little sugary dough balls are my favorites go figure.  I wanted to dip that delicious bread into just the masala sauces.  I am half Filipino so me and rice go together like a fish with water.  Only thing I disliked immensely is the different grain of rice.  If i had my own jasmine rice with me i might have enjoyed everything even more.  I love curry and their curry was not bad I loved the kick to it but I am too spoiled from panang curry. When I do not eat amazing curry I almost need my favorite curry to make up for the not so great curry.  The man I worked for said he liked the food more at tandoori times but liked the price more at Indian paradise. Especially since it was a buffet.

Full Review:

Well all the Indian reviews from the buffay crew finally got to me and I had to have it for a cheat meal :)

Was like Mr Toads wild ride in my truck getting here. A quick U-Turn, brake check, sharp right, up a ramp and into a parking place. That complex is like a maze and I feel lucky that I located my destination.

Walked in the yelp stickered door and was hit with that delicious Indian restaurant smell. What was lacking was the scent of mesquite which you can usually pick up at most places from the tandoor. This was an upclass place so I figured it was just vented well. The place was really cool on the inside having this upscale lounge type feel. Nice and dim and easy on the eyes.

The guy who was double duty as host/waiter seemed a bit annoyed that I was walking in the door at 8:45 when they were open until 10. A tad on the snooty side asked if I was picking up or eating in with a heavy insinuation that I better be picking up. Luckily I was saved by my phone going off as my friend couldn't find the place. I got to bark two for dinner and walked out the door to find my friend.

Was happy when our waitress came to the table since I didn't want much to do with the host. She took our drink order and asked if we needed a few more minutes to which I made the mistake of replying yes. Normally I have these meals pre planned and know exactly what I want but this was a last minute change of destination. I regretted not ordering right then because we didn't see her again for a long while.

My friends have learned that I usually know what's good and just let me order for the table. One of them was an appetizer and as usual I was asked if I wanted that first or with the meal. I try and condense the time that I'm eating bad food to limit the sugar spikes it might create. I'm not even sure why they ask because 9 out of 10 times they bring it first anyway :( this was one of those 9 times. 

We waited for what seemed like an eternity for this one dish to show up. At that point I just started eating because I was super hungry. The rest took another 15 minutes to get there. Kitchen here is REALLLLY slow and we were one of only 3 tables.

One more note.. do yourself a favor and get a table. The booths here are horrible. They press you forward into the table and are very uncomfortable on the back after a while.. and you will be there a while :P

Food Details:

Onion Bhaji:
I ordered these thinking they were something different. They were basically battered onion strings with what I would guess was a plum based sauce. I was expecting the Indian fritters that I couldn't remember the name of at the time. It was still tasty.

Bread Basket:
Sampler of 5 different types of Naan. The only ones I would recommend are the onion and garlic. In the rest the texture was a little different but no flavor profile change and rather dull.

Chicken Tikka Masala:
Mmmm I love this dish and it was pretty darn good here. I have had better but it wasn't in the valley. I haven't chowed on much Indian since returning here many years ago.

Saag Paneer:
Texturally this was way off from what I'm used to. It was almost like a ground spinach. The spice profile of the dish was excellent but I was a little disappointed in the Paneer. This isn't a strong cheese anyway but this really had no flavor to it. I'm used to it adding at least a creamy/richness to the dish. This one had the taste/texture of firm tofu.

Tandoori Chicken:
I was REALLY craving some tandoori chicken and I was disappointed. It wasn't bad but it lacked the bold flavor depth this dish usually has. I also totally missed any mesquite/wood/smoke flavor that should have been there. Between the lack of wood taste and smell I think this place may use a gas driven Tandoori verses a real mesquite charcoal version.

Kheer:
Rice pudding is great stuff and adding almonds and raisins to it... yum. This is where someone played a cruel joke on us. The dessert glass was an odd shape and the spoon didn't fit all the way! If you wanted to retain your manners there was 1/4 of the dessert you were unable to reach. Manners were tossed out the window :)


I agree fully with the 3 stars this place has averaged for itself. I made the mistake of trusting some friends over trusting yelp. I could have done much better that night but this was A-OK and tamed the craving. We felt very rushed towards the end of the dinner to pay and get a move on. We were there in plenty of time to eat and leave before closing had this place operated at a normal pace.

Just remember.. if your friends had good taste.. they would be yelpers :)",3,2010-03-22 22:01

This place is perfect for well versed O.G.'s who like their bone marrow with a side of Bone Thugs. Sophistication and street savvy play well together here without feeling like a gimmick and I believe that blend is what makes a business memorable. 

I arrived on a busy Friday night, around 8:30. Both hostess and server were cool and genuinely friendly. I ordered the Shishito peppers to start, so delicious! The salmon is insane!!! Buttery and accompanied by sweet carrots and green onions.. no words do I have to describe them beyond YUM.. and very well priced at $14.

Taking up the old Coronado house that formerly housed the Lisa G Winebar, The Main Ingredient Ale House and Cafe offers high quality salads, sandwiches, and other assorted snack goodies at an incredibly reasonable (see: one of the best deals in town) prices.

According to New Times food critic Michelle Laudig's previous post on Chow Bella, new owner Michael Diamond wanted to open up a neighborhood wine bar and ale house that would cater to the craft/microbrew crowds of today's foodie culture. Did he succeed?

Boyfriend and I were eager to find out, as the aforementioned post boasted over a handful of draught beers and carefully selected wines from all over the world. Diamond previously worked with Phoenix Winebar power-house Postino, so that alone made me feel all giddy inside. After all, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it?

After driving over rivers and streams that flooded downtown, we were welcomed into a dark and intimate space that felt almost nothing like its former ghost. I was impressed with the atmosphere and general vibe of the house even before taking my seat at the high bar table and was anxious to see what the menu had in store.

First off, the drink list. While Diamond explained trying to shift the bar towards the craft brew crowd, I was a little disappointed in the eight beers on tap. Now don't get me wrong here, Four Peaks is a top notch brewing company, but doesn't every hipster bar and restaurant boast their very own Four Peaks brew? (See: Delux, the Roosevelt, Stax, and so on.)  While the beers on tap were nothing offensive, I was just a little surprised that there were more Four Peaks brews than anything else. It seemed like too safe of a list.  They did however carry the Sonoran Desert Ale, as well as the IRA by craft beer heavy-hitters Stone. (Personally, I think they should have gone with the IPA). The wine list? GREAT. Upon looking at the wine list, I felt as though I had just run around an open meadow in the Swiss Alps. Finally, another non-Postino run wine bar that didn't have the usual Russian Jack Pinot Noir or Sterling whatever mediocre red is popular this year-all at shockingly affordable prices, only two or three glasses at $10 and all else under that.

Food-wise, Main Ingredient hit the spot for me on such a cold and rainy Phoenix night. I opted for their Griddled Cheese; a grilled cheese sandwich made with muenster, cheddar, Havarti, and local tomatoes on sourdough. Ryan was a little more adventurous and tried their Jive Turkey which was oven-roasted turkey, jalapeño cream cheese, organic field greens, and local tomatoes on a freshly-baked baguette. Both were under $9, and came with your choice of a field greens salad or kettle chips.

Other fare: Mac n' Cheese ($7) and an assortment of desserts including cheesecakes by the Arizona Cheesecake Company.
Highly recommended.",4,2010-01-23 20:55

We ended up staying about 3 hours just talking and catching up and even after we'd paid the bill they still checked up on us several times to see if we needed anything and made it clear that we could stay as long as we wanted.

All in all a good night.",4,2009-03-12 15:15

Love the lasagna, whether Bolognese or spinach, chicken or beef (I'm not much on sausage with flavored with anisette  - always hated licorice!), and can speak just as positively of the baked ziti with ricotta and marinara, perfectly spiced Cajun chicken Alfredo, and fettuccine  Alfredo with a perfect, not excessively rich creamy sauce, all currently $8-$9.  I've never even tried the pizzas but my friends have and seem to enjoy them all - and I can attest they look and smell great - and as I'm so hungry right now it's going to be tough to not re-route my trip home for one of those tonight.   Sub sandwiches at $7 or $8 also a pleasure. The ones I've tried include the Meatball Parmigiano, the Heaven's Ham, and I think the Italian Stuffer, well-filled with salami, pepperoni, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato and mayo.  A bonus for the gluten impaired, brown rice pasta available as a substitute on most pasta dishes, at no discernible loss of taste or texture.
  Service is always friendly if not exactly spot-on.  The young wait staff may not ask if you want wine, dessert, or a refill on your tea or soft drink, but it otherwise so affable and everything so affordable, you can overlook it - and just look forward to that cheesecake or tiramisu on a return visit.

In the meantime, I think I'll just order their food.  This particular time I had the bruschetta sandwich, which once I saw it I kind of had to laugh at myself for ordering it.  Bruschetta is kind of just like an open face sandwich, so to make it a sandwich you just have to close the breads over one other and boom sandwich.  And that's pretty much what mine looked like.  Honestly, I was a slightly disappointed by how mine looked especially next to my dad's chicken parm., sandwich that was jam packed.  However, I will say, my sandwich was pretty darn good and was very favorable and even though I probably won't order it the next time I visit, it won't be because it didn't taste good, because it tasted very good.

They have lots of late night specials each day of the week, in addition to their normal happy hour (which includes half priced appy's and cheap 20oz beers).  After 11 they have their late night menu, which is dirt cheap and has a few good things to eat on there (even if they weren't good, you can't really complain because of how cheap they are!)

Not the best food, but it's definitely worth trying.

I would reccomend to anyone wanting to try the sweet and sour tofu (and I'm sure there's just a large bunch of you out there, haha) to be warned that it's not firm tofu that they use. It's almost like the silken type and it was more like drinking dinner, which sounds gross. They have really good lo mein and broccoli with oyster sauce dishes.

I came around 6pm on Friday and was seated at the bar promptly. No complaints there. Service began rather quickly and we decided on onion rings as a starter and a couple mojitos while we sorted through the menu.

The onion rings were very good and the dipping sauce reminded me of the sauce Outback uses with their blooming onion. 

The mojitos we got were the angry berry mojitos with the angry orchard in them. My wife had a sip and hated it so she opted for another one, which the manager happily replaced and didn't charge us for. I didn't mind mine.

We both ordered small orders of wings in Caribbean Jerk and Hot flavors. The Jerk was spicy yet sweet and quite good. The hot was exactly how it sounds.

We ordered another round of mojitos which came out quick. We also ordered some cheese curds, but they never came out. We had to cancel our order because we'd had enough of the noise after sitting for an hour waiting.

We had a bit of a miscommunication, which was my fault, that I didn't know about until I showed up at Kelly's the night of the party. I explained I wanted drinks and heavy appetizers like sliders, guacamole, ceviche, tuna tartar etc. Though I told him this, I never made it clear that I actually wanted to order that and have it ready when the guests arrived. The error was pointed out by our practice manager and Chef was VERY accomodating and quick to get the food started and served.

The restaurant has a very casual ambience and cuisine ranges a mix of American to Asian fusion.

The best part is that they have some amazing soft serve ice creams and milkshakes. I notice that many visitors come here just for the desserts.

Yes, the portions are mongo, but you never leave wishing you had more.

I love that I can go here and still be healthy while eating out. The last two times I went I got the Grilled Vegetable Salad, which was tasty but I felt it was a tad on the oily side. Today I got a summer special -- the Mediterranean Salad, which had chicken, romaine, tomatoes, roasted red peppers, golden raisins, red onion, corn, cilantro and a lemon dressing. It was wonderful! I thought the raisins and corn were odd at first, but I really did enjoy it. And being that it was coming on 2:30 and I hadn't eaten much all day, I snarfed the whole thing down like a little piglet. But it was all good, healthy stuff, so I'm not feeling bad. :)

The downsides to this place are that it can be a little ""crunch-a-fied,"" but hey, I lived in Boulder, Colo., for a number of years and so I tend to like that ""granola"" way.

First, kudos for having fresh squeezed orange juice, not to many places take the time and this one does.

So Fiancee had the crepes and I had the crab and cheddar omelette.  We did share as the crepes where huge!   The crepes had ham, mushrooms, spinach and cheese.  Very impressed, the crepe was perfectly done and beautifully presented.  There was the right amount of balance between the eggs, spinach, mushrooms and cheese.   Did I mention the portions size was huge??  Not kidding as we took a whole one home and I have a good sized appetite. 

The omelette contained crab, cheddar cheese and had ritz crackers on top.  Couldn't understand the ritz cracker thing until I started eating.  Fluffy eggs cooked perfect with a rich cheddar throughout with a good size helping of crab.  Now this is where the Ritz crackers come in- as rich as the components are, the crackers provided just the right balance and saltiness to the dish.  Who would have thought.

At this point, anything you could have done to the hash browns or pancakes that came with the omelette wouldn't have mattered, but hash browns cooked perfectly and the pancakes I was again impressed.  Light, almost buttermilk but something different and by different I meant delicious.

BstlkZRhkmSnU8WOdyGCsQ,WMMI5Q4Rmm1Rqdu0jOvyhQ,#NAME?,"Sure feels like I've been getting to know the area around Scottsdale Road & Shea Boulevard pretty well of late.  D'Lite, Butterfield's, Hop Doddy, and Zak's Chocolate are a few of my more recent discoveries in this neighborhood.  Now you can add Eggstasy, a breakfast concept spot I'd bookmarked a few months ago.  Empty fridge on a Sunday before the groceries stores were open meant I was in search of a good breakfast to start the day.  Thankfully Eggstasy opens its doors at 6:30am daily.  Let's eat.

You'll find Eggstacy in the Agua Caliente center on the north side of 69th Street & Shea.  Enter through the archway, then turn right into the shopping center where you'll find Eggstacy set near the southeast corner.  I came right at opening on Sunday and grabbed a table next to the kitchen.  Chicago transplant Peter Verros is the man behind this large open air breakfast and lunch spot, which he originally opened in Chicago before deciding to pack up shop and instead move his operation to Scottsdale.  His Scottsdale restaurant can seat at least 200 or more at a time including the patio.  But even the interior restaurant is open to the elements as the bar area is setup in a wide open indoor/outdoor fashion.  The morning was perfect outside so no worries today, though I do wonder how they mitigate the summer heat.  Anyways, onto the food.

The menu is quite vast and contains most of your breakfast standards.  Egg dishes (obviously), pancakes, french toast dishes, skillets, waffles, benedicts, and even some crepes.  And this being Scottsdale you'll also find a large array of healthier as well as some gourmet breakfast items from something called a skinny B***h to a wild smoked salmon dish.  The dish I wanted was the first one listed on the menu.  The Eggasm is listed as an appetizer but for $9 I fully expected something pretty filling.  The description read like a sandwich but I couldn't find any Yelp photos to confirm that so I ordered this in the blind.  I also ordered perhaps their most unique side offering, their chorizo cheddar grits.  Add some fresh squeezed OJ to wash it down and I was ready to go.

The Eggasm was nothing like I pictured.  Instead of a sandwich, it came as a plate full of toasted ciabatta bread topped with specs of prosciutto, chives, and shaved parmesan cheese.  Then at the other end of the plate was a jar full of coddled eggs and potato puree, in a form soft enough to act as a spread for the ciabatta bread.  Basically just grab small spoonfuls of the egg/potato jar mix and throw it on the ciabatta and munch away.  While not what I was expecting, it was truly delicious.  The prosciutto and parmesan cheese helped elevate the flavor profile beautifully while the bread gave it the crunchy texture.  A very pleasant surprise dish I never saw coming.  The grits were also tasty, albeit a little heavy and the portion size of the side is probably meant to be shared by two.  I mixed in a little of the grits with the Eggasm at times and the two dishes really work well together.  My only big disappointment was the OJ honestly.  Fresh squeezed is fine and a little pulp is okay by me, but honestly Eggstasy's OJ was chalked full of pulp.  For others, this may not be hangup.  But for me I don't want pulp unless I'm just eating an orange straight.  When it comes to juice, I'd greatly appreciate some of that pulp strained out.

Total cost for the food, OJ, tax and tip came to about $25.  Service was friendly and prompt (I was one of the few early risers on Sunday so I suppose that was a given), and the food items I chose were a nice twist on the usual breakfast fare.  The restaurant itself is an ideal space for breakfast and lunch during the cooler months in the valley and the bar area in particular provides some great people watching vantage points.  As I write this they'll soon be opening a second location just east of here on Shea & Via Linda.  I came for Eggstasy and ended up having an Eggasm.  The puns here quite literally write themselves.",4,2017-10-29 17:10

I like that it's casual yet still dressy and slightly upscale. You know what I mean? Like it still feels like Scottsdale nightlife but not what people think of as Scottsdale nightlife that has them fleeing to Tempe or Phoenix. Great house cocktails (AZ Mule is a must try) and generally a good mix between ""beautiful people"" and average folks. In fact, I would say the crowd is diverse by Scottsdale standards. I mostly come here at night but the food is pretty good too. One thing to note (and I say this only because I've seen many a person fall for this) there is one bathroom that is in plain sight and it's a onesie but that's not the only bathroom walk passed the bar and hang a left. I know, what a silly and unsexy thing to write about in a review of a sexy little bar but I know every woman reading this can attest that knowing the bathroom situation is important. :-)",4,2013-12-11 19:01

If you are a picky eater, this may not be the place for you, because the chef (Chris) greets every person, speaks with him/her briefly, and decides what ingredients are the perfect blend.

In some ways, it is unfortunate that this cafe is so small (maybe 6-8 indoor tables???), but then one would never feel the personal touch that such a small cafe affords.

The Fake Mediterranean stuff like the lavosh pizza are good, but I can't really say that anything else is anything but adequate.  Falafel is ok there.

The most bangin thing is the red pepper hummus, but I would just buy it to go, cause to me, the pitas taste like they bought them at fry's.

Salads are huge here, if you're into those for a meal.  Other than that it's just doing what it's supposed to, nothing above and beyond.  I usually find that it's very crowded there too.  I would rather hit up Haji's.",3,2008-09-08 3:39
pwrROZ0a6hryIHQnxSPcbg,DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA,Xg5qEQiB-7L6kGJ5F4K3bQ,"I'm kicking them down to a 4.5 for this recent visit.  I would normally drop a 4.5 to a 4 star review, but all of my prior experiences have been 5 Star, so I will leave them at 5 Star this time. 

Strategically, I went here the Saturday before Thanksgiving because I'd hoped that the link would not be as long as I've heard it has grown.  I arrived at 10:20 (I was 4th in line) and I was back in my car by 11:15.  Great for me.  My plan actually paid off!  Even at 11, the line was not very long at all.

Funny thing happened that I must share.  While waiting in line, a cab pulls up about 10:40, out hops 2 ladies with their suitcases.  They were on their way to the airport, but wanted to stop by to have this food and maybe take some with them.  HA!  For some folks this is really good BBQ.  For Phoenix, this is definitely the best you can get.

Please check my previous review WRT to my favorites here and my thoughts about this restaurant.  None of that has changed.  

As for my most recent visit, I was somewhat disappointed with the depth of the taste of the meat.  It lacked the seasoned flavor I'd grown accustomed to having!  On this visit I ordered:

Pork Ribs (not nearly as flavorful as they were on my last visit)
Brisket (Somewhat not as flavorful, but still the best)
Beef Rib (Still very good)
Sausage (Still very good)

I was somewhat taken aback by the lack of flavor in the ribs.  Albeit, in the past I have stated that I think my dad cooks the best smoke ribs of any place I've ever had BBQ.  

I found it interesting to compare how the prices have not changed much in past 17 months.

JK1jIRTpPV2etCYJPRdREw,Rv6Rn056y-eq4Ha_ZaQjuw,f30-DOoIxvoV9btiDvKMTw,"It is official - we have new favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  Hands down, Joe's Midnight Run is the best mix of unique menu selection, outstanding food quality, notable cocktail and beer list, excellent service and overall enjoyable atmosphere in the valley.

The restaurant has an open kitchen concept with full seating around the line, offering a front row seat to the eye candy that the chef and his staff are pushing out each night.  Seriously, just the creative and artistic presentation of these dishes is enough reason too come to Joe's and sit on the line while you eat.  I'm sure that the tables and booths are also nice, but I cannot imagine sitting anywhere else, if given the choice.

It was my birthday, so we were there to eat, and to drink.  We arrived early (around 5:30) and were happy to find an incredible happy hour - $2 off all menu items.  The menu offers some truly impressive small plates and entrees, and because it was our first time there, we opted for variety, ordering a large volume of small plates to try as much as possible.

We got a few very cool cocktails, then laid into a wide range of small plates.  They were all generously sized and served with complimentary sides.  The grilled octopus was done perfectly - tender and fresh, well seasoned and served with spiced potatoes.  The skirt steak with marinated peppers and chimichurri was my wife's favorite.  Well portioned, medium rare and flavorful.  We got the flash-fried shishito peppers which are a huge pile of peppers served with a delicious lemon garlic aioli dipping sauce.  The large portion of bone marrow was cooked just right with a little sea salt and some crusty bread.  My favorite of all were the sweetbreads.  I am a huge sweetbread fan, and preparation is everything.  They can be really good, or really bad, and these were the best I've ever had - anywhere.  They were the perfect temperature with a light white wine caper sauce that was subtle and complimentary.  We also got the cantina poutine.  This was another great dish, topped with chorizo gravy and mahon cheese, but it is a HUGE portion, and we simply could not finish it.  When we come back, I would order this by itself with drinks.  But in the context of the other plates, I'd rather go with the more esoteric menu items.  In summary - WOW.  You just don't find those kind of dishes in Phoenix, especially in fun atmosphere like this.

In the background I had several beers from their strong beer selection, largely focused on local AZ craft brews.  My wife had a few more cocktails.  And although we forgot to order it, you can get a 40oz bottle of King Cobra malt liquor with your meal.  Awesome.

A few words about the service.  Our server was outstanding.  Helpful, friendly, attentive, and just a pleasure to have around.  He was supported by several other teammates who were constantly assisting him with the many dishes that we ordered.  They recognized that it was my birthday very early on, and went far out of their way to make our first time in, and our night in general, extremely memorable.  We spoke to the chef several times, and all of the line cooks were interactive and friendly while they worked in the hot kitchen.  The manager also came over to speak with us, which brings me to dessert.

I've already stated that the sweetbreads were the best that I have ever had, and our outrageous dessert at Joe's is the second dish that met that criteria.  At the managers suggestion, we had the tart tatin, an apple dish that is already phenomenal, but was made extraordinary with the addition of a healthy slab of foie gras right in the middle.  The pairing was surprisingly ideal, with the foie melting into the apple tart, and a side of vanilla ice cream to top it off.

So when we return to Joe's Midnight Run, it will be for so many reasons.  We cannot wait to try their brunch, bring our friends, and work our way through the rest of this unique menu.  The valley really needed a place like this.  Great job.",5,2016-09-22 3:36

This is another on my short list of places I just haven't been able to get to for some reason.  We met up at 1 and grabbed a table outside.  It was an absolutely gorgeous day and G was raving about the mac-and-cheese.  We both ordered that and it was really yummy.  Prepared like a casserole, it was full of onion and green chili, with a nice crust.  I'm pretty sure it's the best  I've had!  We were also there during HH and had some delicious beverages; my selection was the East Coast (?) and it was good enough that I had 2.

So TMI, here are some suggestions for getting the coveted 5th star:  try a different side accompaniment.for the mac-and-cheese.  The toast is weirdly out of place; perhaps a couple of oven-dried tomatoes would be good beside that dish and the toast can be crumbled on the top.  Additionally, the drinks I had were pricey, even at 1/2 off.  You're in a competitive neighborhood and shaving some of that cost off will get repeat business

The ordering system does take a little getting used to.  

The kids were a little concerned that there was no hot sauce and even suggested taking out to ensure they had some...the concern was a non-issue since there were some sauces by the soda fountain.

The kids loved the Cuban black beans.  I couldn't get past the look and texture.  Not sure why, it's not a texture any different than a refried bean, guess I just don't like to see it so dark.

Kids had the popular Jade Red Chicken and Carnitas quesadillas.  The hubbie and I stuck w/ bowls.  He had the Chinese BBQ Pork and I had the Chicken Diablo.  Both the hubbie and son didn't think the Diablo was too spicy, but I found that it is a cumulative hot that builds as you eat more; my mouth was on fire by the time I finished my meal.

GovOKn29gc5tXQnXVcvtTg,Nkne0ukWVrzL3HFf1JuOmw,dUffgo9Lh_Vk9TLuFR5ywg,"I have never been disappointed at Oregano's. My friend and I were going there about once a month for a year and a half while we were in school. I had never been here so she introduced me. I have now been there several times and this is my favorite of the locations. The tasters I've tried are the toasted ravioli espaniol, boom dip, guaca tony, and Lawrence's stuffed mushrooms.  The ravioli is divine with a nice kick in the cheese and the marinara is my favorite of all of the the marinaras I have tasted.  The boom dip is rich and creamy and the chips are actually a thin crust pizza with cheese on top, there are no words to describe how absolutely wonderful it is.  The guaca tony has the same thin crust pizza to smear guac on and from what I hear the guac is phenomenal, stupid allergies prohibit me tasting.  The stuffed mushrooms are more of a meal than a taster and are a lot meatier than I had imagined but was rich and delicious.  If you get tasters just know that they are huge and that if you plan on dessert it is important to have plenty of people to share with unless you plan on not eating lunch/dinner. 
In regards to the wings my husband has thoroughly enjoyed the wings of fire and says that they are a different kind of hot more black pepper than hot sauce hot.  He says that they were surprising but that they were a good change.  
The salads are like everything else on the menu huge and a little different.  The Julius Caesar has a dressing that is Caesar with a little bit of a different kick.  I normally ask for extra dressing but there was flavor in every bite.  When you add chicken it is finally sliced and you can never get a bite without the chicken, I usually share this with my daughter because it is just to big for one person.  My husband has said that the big beefstro and the antipasto thing are both the best salads he has ever had.  This is high praise since he tends to not like going out.  Every time we have gone out since he compares every salad he comes in contact with the salads from Oregano's and so his taste for other salads has become ruined.  My father-in-law says that the southwestern shrimp caesar is better than he ever imagined.  The shrimp was so tasty that even I liked it and my daughter started trying to steal salad.  
We have tried two of the sandwiches sort of on accident.  The Italian stuffed and the fresh grilled Italian sausage.  My mother-in-law meant to order the fresh grilled Italian sausage but accidentally said the Italian stuffed and when it came out she said it was delicious but that she wanted the sausage and mentioned it to the waitress.  The waitress reordered the sausage sandwich and wrapped it up for her to take home and didn't even charge us for it.  I think this really says something about the level of customer service that I have seen every time we go.  We all tasted both and my mother-in-law who is rarely impressed has suggested this place numerous times based on this, oh and dessert. 
The pizzas are great. I normally don't like the thin crust but feel that they pack a lot in. I read in a review that the Aunt Margarita had no flavor which I thought was odd. It definitely isn't as greasy as some of the pizzas but it has some darn good flavor. The tomatoes are always done just right to give you that juicy tomato quality.
My daughter always gets the pasta with the pesto sauce.  She loves the pesto and enjoys the pesto penne bake.  I truly love the ziti since it is flavorful and huge enough for three meals.  I don't really like their Alfredo the dark but it isn't the worst alfredo that I have had.  
For dessert I have only ever had their pizza cookie and don't see any reason to change this in the future.  I have had pizza cookie at many places but non that are even close to as yummy as the ones her at Oregano's.  
You will definitely find me at an Oregano's again soon.",5,2011-11-07 1:08

The asian food here is of very high quality, great quantity, and affordable...especially at lunch time.  My wife will even drive all the way from Carefree sometimes just to go to lunch with me at TAD (and she HATES to drive).  The owner, Young, and the girl that takes orders and brings them out, are as nice as can be.  They always have a smile and a hello to share.  Go there more than a couple of times and you are a friend.  How great an owner takes such interest in his customers!

In terms of food it is very hard to go wrong here.  My favorite is the Sweet and Pungent Chicken or Shrimp.  The coating is perfectly crispy and the sauce glazes each piece perfectly.  Think Orange Chicken with a little kick.  Other items that are great are the Chow Mein with it's slight smokiness, Tom Yum Soup with Noodles has a nicely flavored broth and they will spice it however you like.  Also comes with a separate container full of noodles for take away.  Finally,  my son loves the Yellow Panang Curry.  Great veggie selection and plenty of whatever protein you choose to put in it.  He gets angry when I eat his leftovers on this dish.  Don't feel sorry for him as he has eaten more than his fair share of my leftovers while I toil away at work!

I ordered the brisket sandwich with onion rings and my wife ordered the 2-meat plate with brisket and ribs, which came with baked beans, homemade potato chips and corn muffins. Everything was out-of-this-world delicious!  My sandwich came on a wonderfully tasty brioche bun and the brisket was some of the most mouth-watering brisket I've ever had anywhere.  At 1/2 pound of meat it was a perfect combination of quality & quantity.  My wife couldn't stop raving about her choice and especially the house-made corn muffins, which stole the show.  The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and perfectly sauced for maximum flavor.  The baked beans were excellent and so was her brisket.

All in all, we'd say there's a new BBQ sheriff in town...at BLD!  Great food with great service at reasonable prices...what more can you ask.

rX68ZIEfU6xB_ALyuPw5Xw,SCYd8BnpdTCoGIFUIw_SWA,cs1qJvnWUg_f8g020z_3PQ,"Chris Bianco opened this restaurant after the success of his downtown pizzeria. The menu here is expanded, and reservations are accepted.

I arrived @ 7:00 with two companions and was seated immediately. The waiter was friendly, and had a good knowledge of the food and how it was prepared. We decided to order several entree's and share them so that everyone could taste.

We ordered the Papparadelle with Bolognese Sauce, Beef Braciole or Involtini if you are in Italy, and a Pizza Margherita.

The Papparadelle came with fluted edges, cooked reasonably al dente, with an excellent Bolognese sauce loaded with chunks of meat. I found it to be on par with any I have ever eaten, though on a personal note I prefer the pasta to be more rustic and hand cut or torn into uneven ""rags"".

My companions did not care for the Beef Braciole as much as I did, but allowing for different tastes as well as living in vastly different locations, I can accept that.  I found the meat to be beautifully cooked, nicely presented on a bed of cooked cauliflower, and served with some properly roasted onions.  Many people who make this dish tend to overpower it with lots of cheese and bread crumbs wrapped up in the beef.Unlike many variations on this recipe, this one was not overly salted or spiced, which I personally appreciated, as the flavor of the range fed beef came out nicely.

Many reviewers have said that the pizza is the best in the United States. I would differ with that opinion. Certainly, the pizza is very good, but I've eaten many a pizza that I felt was as good. The crust has a good flavor, is nicely thin with a nice edge, but the one we were served had an undercooked center that flopped down when picked up. The cheese is handmade on the premises, and is a real treat, melting into a lacy puddle swimming in a pool of an excellent sauce. 

My biggest criticism was with the basil. This pizza is supposed to represent the Italian flag - 3 colors - red (sauce), white (cheese) and green (basil). The pizza was cut into 6 pieces and 5 leaves of basil were put on it. One person would not get a real piece of pizza margherita. Worse still, to me is that you only get a leaf of basil. Which bite do you eat it with? In my mind, the best pizza margherita I have ever eaten had a chiffonade of basil sprinkled all over it, so that you got some basil with each bite. My understanding is that that is how the pizza was supposed to be made originally. You wouldn't serve the queen one leaf of basil, now would you?

I must make mention of the bread that came with the meal. I don't know if it is made on the premises or not, but it was wonderfully crusty, with a chewy interior and a superior texture. It was served with a little extra virgin olive oil, and was really excellent.

Overall, the premises were clean, though a little noisy at times. I'm hoping that Chris will put a whole lot more basil on his pizza's, as that is a basic part of the flavor of it.

4 stars for excellent service, good food, and general cleanliness.",4,2014-01-22 4:47

FOOD
I am usually not a fan of hummus- but this was the first place I've gone and liked the hummus. It was delicious! Every dish around us that was brought out to other tables looked delicious.

AMBIANCE
The decor is unique- there are paintings (that are for sale) on the walls. The kitchen is open and you can view it from the dining area. 
It's noisy and usually busy. There's not a lot of room when you enter the main door. If one or more parties are waiting you may need to step outside to have any room.

Parking was tight. Small parking lot in the back with little to no parking on a busy night...
There was a half hr wait but we seated instantly at the bar. Not my ideal seating but I don't like waiting, so it is what it is.
Bartender was friendly. Tried the Belini? An alcoholic slushi drink someone else had posted a picture of. I could be completely wrong on the name. Wasn't as strong as I'd like, but tasty.
We got a big caesar salad to start. Was big enough for two people. Was just ok...kind of dry in my opinion. Definitely could've used more dressing. Probably wouldn't get again- their other salads look a lot better anyways.
Somehow in all this, we changed our minds about deep dish (sorry chi town), and went with a ""make your own"" thin crust. I got sausage, pepperoni, spiced feta, roasted garlic, and spinach on my half and my husband got sausage, pepperoni, garlic, and bacon on his.
I was a little worried about my choices and how they'd turn out shortly after we placed the order. Those ingredients can definitely overwhelm a pizza. The wait was usual...half hr maybe?
Lemme tell you.....that pizza was one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten.......they didn't put TOO much of each topping, so you didn't get too much of one flavor overpowering another (aka garlic or feta). Everything blended perfectly and was so stinkin delicious I never wanted it to end......my husband loved his just as much. 
Overall for the salad, pizza, 2 beers, 2 ""specialty"" drinks, and a tip....the final bill came to around $77. Kind of expensive in my opinion. Adding your own toppings individually can get kind of pricey so I'd probably get a pizza off the menu choices next time? Even though the make your own combo I got was DIVINE....
I'm giving this place 4 stars because despite some minor setbacks, the pizza was absolutely PERFECT. The pricing dissapoints me the most really. If it were cheaper, I'd frequent here once a week. Lol.",4,2015-11-23 10:32

You get to choose from soup, tacos or enchiladas and pick out your choice of meats and cheeses. After they stick it in the oven to get it all melty and toasty you add on veggies and our salas, perhaps grab and beer and your done.

I came not too long after it opened and it took a while to get my order in. A lot of that had to do with that fact that none of us really knew what our choices were. The menus aren't that clear so I found  myself guessing up to the last minute before making a rush decision as to not hold up the line any more.

 It was a little haphazard behind the counter as well because the staff didn't quite seem to know what was going on or what they were supposed to do. It was like a poor assembly line that went horribly slow to suddenly speed up. It was like watching Lucy and Ethel make enchiladas.

Once i got my order though the meat was tender and delicious and I really enjoyed it. I would probably go just a little less melty next time.

It was moderately busy but not loud.  Walked up to the bar and was instantly greeted by the bartender. Hugh selection of tequilas and draft beer. Too bad it was lunch time and I have to go back to work. I had a smothered burro and a street taco. I would come back for the taco alone.  Tasted fresh and looked great. The red Chx burro was flavorful but a little too wet for my taste.  Great atmosphere and with the cooler weather it is a nice place to grab lunch on the patio.,4,2015-10-27 19:50

And let's not forget the lobster on a cauliflower couscous-like bed....a truly inspired dish!

Also, the owner infuses his own concoctions of liquor and I had a chance to try his newly distilled Manhattan...wowza! All the drinks are craft-style and the wine list is quite amazing as well.

My girlfriend and I came during restaurant week. It was packed when we arrived at 8:00 p.m. on a Tuesday night, I would recommend rezzies. For starters my friend had the soup and I had the cheese plate, both were delish. The cheese plate came with the cutest, tiny spoons and jars for jam and mustard... took everything I had to not put them in my purse. I can't remember what my main dish was called but it was two pieces of fried fish with a crab cake in the middle, topped with gravy and capers and a side of steamed spinach.

Beef Pies - Excellent!!!  Very tasty and yummy.
Pork Potstickers -  Freshly made and cooked.  These are very good.  But found out Northern style, you do not use soy sauce for dipping sauce.  Vinegar is the thing.
Green Onion Pancakes -  It was fresh but the layers of dough were not there.  OK.
Fried Beef Bun - These are actually steamed.  Doughy but good.
Lamb Skewers - My family inhaled them.  And said it was great.

I'm pretty sure this sandwich has been life changing because I haven't looked at bacon the same way since I had this sandwich. 

They use tender belly bacon and cook it to crispy perfection. The BLT is of course compiled of bacon, lettuce and tomatoes, but they add a chipotle mayo, avocado and red onions on sourdough bread. They give you the option of a lightly dressed greens or chips with a pickle. I actually found out about this place on the PBS show, Check Please Arizona in 2013. I remember a lady on the show talking about how good her BLT was and I thought to myself, how good can a BLT be?

The menu is very varied, and just about everything I try is good. The crowd is very different from the typical Scottsdale crowd, and the overall vibe is just right.  I tend to eat late, and it's nice to have a place that is not empty at 9pm. 

They don't allow smoking on the patio which is another big plus. 

Even though I gave them 5 stars, there are a couple of issues. 1) the place can be freezing inside - more so in summer, ironically - due to a/c being on way too cold. I've spoken to several waiters/waitresses, they say there is one manager there who insists on keeping the place icy cold inside, summer and winter. I always sit outside in summer, but in winter I do sometimes feel too cold.  2) there is one sub-standard waitress who has a definite 'attitude'.  This is sad because 99% of the staff are absolutely fantastic.  This one lady looks like she really feels the job is beneath her.

Since she had never been here before, and we were both starving, we decided to order 3 items and split them: soup of the day, grilled mozzarella kabob and salmon davida (yes, again, it was that good). 
The soup was tomato based, with cauliflowers and some other veggie, with a slice of toasted french bread with spread. It was delightful, and the bread's spread was slightly tangy, enough to kick off your appetite.
Grilled mozzarella kabob came with a ""head"" of romain lettuce, also grilled; big enough as a salad entree. The whole dish was drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

Turns out Jaun's doesn't have WiFi.  Whatevs'.  That might have put a magic bullet in my plans, but I wasn't going to be discouraged in chasing the truth.  Speaking of the truth, Jaun's is legit.  Let me tell you why.

The service has always been good in my experiences there, and I've been coming to this little neighborhood joint with my family ever since I was old enough to first learn about the Gulf of Tonkin.  So like, seven?  The restaurant has always been family owned and the dad/mom that own it will always recognize you like how I can recognize an obvious government cover up.  Puercos...

The food's consistently good, and cheaply priced.  I tend to get the #17 combo plate with lengua tacos, rice and beans.  Nom.  Trust me - carne asada fans, don't be afraid of eating tongue.  You already eat up enough of it from politicians, might as well branch out to something honestly good.  Smother everything in that salsa of theirs and finish it all off with some sopapillas?  With the honey?  Please.  You'll be so content that you'll go right back to being a mindless drone without a second thought.  Operation Northwoods who??  Exactly.  You shill.  You happy, full, shill.

Don't even get me started on their #6 chimichanga plate.  Throw some red sauce and guac on that thang'.  Hope you don't have to go back to the office.  It'll leave you leaning back, and to the left.

Anyways, the Warren Commission couldn't even keep this place under wraps.  It's clearly a staple in the neighborhood with the amount of regulars lined up out the door on that grassy knoll.  I mean side walk.  Sorry...

I really love their margarita selection, and I usually choose a higher end one. The Agave is my favorite by far, but I also like The Diamond. However, it must be said that both of these are completely bartender dependent so somewhat inconsistent, which can be a little frustrating because of the premium price. If I'm in a ""bulk drinking"" mode, the house frozen margarita is really good. Better than a lot of other places upgraded ones. They use a decent reposado in their recipe, which makes a difference. I don't know if they make their own mix, but if not, whatever they use is pretty good. Sweet, of course, but better than many others I've tried. They serve beer and it's cold, says my husband. So, drinks are covered, but what about the food? Not so much...not bad, really, but not good either. If I was only rating this as a bar, they would definitely get 4 to 5 stars. But, the food and inconsistent service reduces my rating by a star.

The one thing we do like is the spinach queso dip at happy hour time. It is really good, and they put little chunks of cream cheese in it, which is YUMMY. They are VERY stingy with the pico de gallo though, Usually about 1 teaspoon on the whole dish. We have been charged inconsistently for a side of pico to add. It has ranged from 99 cents to $2.49. The other downside is that their house salsas are both awful. Truly awful. They are chipotle something or other, but they taste like ketchup with a burnt rubber aroma. Yucky. That's a downside. The food is OK. I've tried a salad, the chimichanga (which is labeled very spicy and IS NOT), which comes with burnt rubber sauce, so ask for them to leave it off. My husband had the shrimp enchiladas, which were ""OK, but kind of rubbery and a little fishy"" and a shredded pork burrito, which he says was good and will be what he orders from now on. We have also had their nachos, which are OK too.",3,2015-08-22 23:21

I didn't expect this place to have such an upscale feel.  The name and the color of the door and signage led me to believe that I was going to be walking into a unique situation. The menu selection is basic.  Nothing notable or super creative.
The theme was very little protein.  The poke app was MAYBE 2 ounces of fish with too much sauce on an oversized wonton.
The tuna bahn mi had about 3 ounces of fish (thinly sliced).  The baguette was not toasted and was heavily doused in vinegar.
I don't know how the 900 degree oven plays a role, I suppose I will never find out since I don't have a strong desire to return.

There was a wait while the stuff cooked in the oven. Maybe should start a number system. It's not quick like chipotle so having your guests stand 6+ min in line is not fun. It would have been better if I went all the way through placed my order paid and then they said it was ready. No plastic forks were available I had to ask. And the energy was okay.

If it's your first visit, tell them so you can get the menu tour, which is some of their more popular items. You fill your order out on a card and hand it over to the cashier, which then reads it back to you so I don't see how it really saves any time.

There are seemingly countless options, as they have 15 entrees, each one can come alone, in a burrito, or in a quesadilla, and you get two entrees in a combo platter. The platter also comes with your choice of 5 rices and 2 beans (don't bother with the pinto, go for the house-recipe Cuban beans). My wife and I agree that the Jade Red chicken is the best (and the menu proclaims it as the most popular). Their Jerk chicken is very spicy, but the jerk fried rice has just the right amount of heat.  All entrees come with fresh baked snickerdoodles (or on Saturdays, the option for a chocolate cookie). 

After ordering, you find a seat in the cafeteria-style dining room, or outdoors on a nice day (not July or August). The location is tough to find though, hidden in the back behind a Walgreens and Brake shop. Still, it's worth the small hunt.

Food was delicious and filling. I wish the cheese was melted a little bit more. The sandwich was supposed to be a hot sand which but was brought out to us barely warm. It was still delicious though.

So we decided to try the newest place in my new hood. Seated promptly, plenty of room, greeted promptly and I will say Jessica was very nice. They seemed maybe a bit overwhelmed although the place wasn't that busy. We ordered the chips and dip and was told they were out of chips. We decided on fried pickles ,which were great, and pretzels and cheese. The cheese sauce wasn't that great. All 6 of us ordered and had minor requests (no tomatoes or no sauce etc) and 2 of them were right. I would suggest telling your servers that if they're busy and have a 6 top with special instructions, to WRITE IT DOWN. No paper and pen is a 100% rookie move. Our server along with her busser kept the drinks full except for the 1 guy drinking beer at our table. Then one of our late comers ordered the poppers which said ""stuffed with smoked cream cheese"" which was not true. They were stuffed with cheese sauce and overcooked. 1 friend and I both had the french dip burger, mine had the horseradish sauce that I requested none of but she fixed it and it was just ok, the other 2 had the other burger which was like a big mac they said and 1 had the grilled cheese which she enjoyed with the chili. Nothing was mind blowing and in fact, we had 3 more people join us after we ate and we told them to go to the Vig and we left. As we were getting our stuff, I noticed a server walk by with chips and dip that we were told you were out of. I get it that they may have made more but we should've been informed of that because 4 of us had to order a different side with our meals because she said there were none.",3,2018-01-01 23:04

Hpbsf7FY_Go_BLeUx5eX7w,WMMI5Q4Rmm1Rqdu0jOvyhQ,wHq1efQVz17338k_aUOX3w,"Ever since I moved Downtown, Hob Nobs is one of those places that has been something of a Yelp enigma for me.  Were they trying to be a neighborhood coffee house as they were when this quaint location used to be the Willow House?  Are they trying to be a pizzeria?  A sandwich spot?  A wine bar?  I tried reading several Yelp reviews about the place, but I still couldn't figure it out.  There were also (as I write this) almost no photos of the food or the restaurant itself on Yelp, despite more than 170 reviews.  Huh?  Finally I just decided to give it a shot for dinner on a Saturday evening.

On the southeast corner of 3rd Ave & McDowell, Hob Nobs sits in an old bungalow right between the Roosevelt & Willo neighborhoods.  The first and most obvious observation when you arrive here is that parking is scarce.  Hob Nobs can probably accommodate well over a hundred people at capacity, but has parking for barely a fraction of that.  Fortunately I found a spot this time.  There's a sizable outdoor patio and plenty of seating inside as well (including couches or high tables if that's your preference).  No waiter service here as you go up and order at the front counter and they bring it out to you.  As I alluded to earlier, the menu here is pretty expansive.  They have breakfast and brunch items, salads, sandwiches, wraps, pizzas, coffee, beers, wines, mixed drinks, and even baked goods.  Certainly not what you'd expect given the quaint size of the front counter and kitchen.  There were only a small handful of folks in the restaurant so finding time to read the menu and finding a seat were fairly easy this time around.

I decided to go with their four cheese chicken quesadilla for an appetizer & their Secret sandwich (don't ask me why they call it that).  Total for the two items, plus a water and tax came to about $20.  I grabbed a spot in the front dining area facing the fireplace.  So I waited, and I waited, and I waited.  It took just under a half hour from the time I ordered to get my food.  I can forgive a lengthier wait for fresh scratch made food, but if the food took this long with the restaurant not even a quarter full, how long would it take with a full house?  When I got my food at last, neither item looked as I had expected.  Let's start with the quesadilla.  Big enough to share, but no where near the amount of cheese I was expecting.  I could pick up a couple of different cheeses, but honestly the lettuce and tomato (two items I didn't know were going to be in my quesadilla) were the dominant flavors.  As a result, the quesadilla had the consistency of a bland salad moreso than a cheesy filler.  Now the Secret sandwich.  Fruit (grapes and strawberries from what I gathered), and (supposedly) four cheeses on toasted wheat berry bread.  The big secret (apparently) was the side potato salad they provided.  It was fine, but an odd accompaniment for this type of sandwich to be honest.  As for the sandwich?  I've had a number of innovative takes on the classic grilled cheese in my time, but this one also fell woefully short of expectations.  Yet again, where's the cheese?  There were generous chunks of fruit, which is fine.  But barely any cheese that I could make out.  For twenty dollars and more than 20 minutes worth of waiting, I can't say my first experience here was a favorable one.

I have no grudges against the counter staff or the guy who brought my food out to me.  They were more than adequate.  And the aesthetics of the place are pleasant enough that this spot would probably work as a neighborhood haunt to relax, talk, and have a drink.  But as a restaurant, I really feel like Hob Nobs needs to rethink their business model in a big way.  For starters, provide a little more disclosure on your menu about what exactly will be on my plate (this includes both the in house and online menus by the way).  Second, don't try to be good at everything.  Restaurants that try to be good at everything often aren't really good at anything.  My advice?  Trim the menu in half (if not more) focusing only on the greatest hits.  A smaller selection can be great as long as the options available are great ones.  Third, hire wait staff.  If you only want to be a coffee house you can get away with no waiters or waitresses.  When you're a full fledged restaurant serving a huge menu, making customers choose on the fly while standing in line can be dicey.  Having wait staff helps guide customers at their pace.

So now I sort of get why Hob Nobs was always a mystery.  Even after my first experience, much of what Hobs Nobs brings to the table makes me scratch my head.  The options seem enticing enough, but there's really no rhyme or reason to much of the execution.  I'm sure their intentions are good and the folks there seem very nice.  But with the Downtown culinary scene becoming ever more competitive and the choices better than ever, Hob Nobs will need to do some soul searching if they're to thrive in this evolving landscape.",2,2015-07-19 2:18

We ordered the $11 pretzels with ""provolone"" cheese... and while the pretzels were great (and plentiful) and the cheese was good, it was legitimately Velveeta and notsomuch provolone.

I ordered a Mediterranean salad which they accidentally added chicken to and I was required to wait awhile but received no discount. It was good, but only about 40% bigger than my husband's side salad with his turkey sandwich.

They do have a kid's menu, but it's not printed. It's a laundry list of all things kids like. My kids had the mac-n-cheese and it definitely tasted like the same cheese sauce from the pretzels, though good.

Place was packed and smelling good, usually  a good sign.  I ordered the two meat meal; sliced brisket, ribs and the vegetable of the day.  My wife had a pulled pork sandwich.  
     The meats were excellent.  Brisket was falling apart with a terrific, flavorful bark. I gotta say the dry rub definitely stood out for me, literally could eat the meal dry if I hadnt been wanting to taste the sauces.  The ribs were cooked perfectly, and the meat easily came off the bone with no resistance.  The vegetable was seasoned great and the corn muffin was a pleasent surprise.
     As far as service, the place is quick and high energy.  I'd suggest you figure out what you want before going up to order as this place starts busy and stays busy till the meat runs out.  Drinks and BBQ sauce are self-serve and the BBQ sauce is kept nice and warm as well using a pretty nifty condement dispenser.

It is a typical meal and since our favorite Indian place was closed, we decided to try Taj Mahal based on the yelp reviews. I was pretty disappointed and felt kinda ripped off.

First for the price ($50) you get 1 Chinese take out box of rice, 2 small plastic containers of butter chicken (more butter sauce than chicken womp, womp) and 2 pieces of garlic naan. The naan is pre cut for you into triangles. We got 4 triangles per person...so...hmm....2 pieces of naan cut into fourths? Was that really 2 separate orders? Stop cutting the naan please.

The naan had no garlic and not cilantro...was just plain. We live pretty far from this place so we just ate what we had.

yxr1kdksx2OGwbLpLqXpqQ,ZaUSKKKcD6SopY299FGdiA,Xg5qEQiB-7L6kGJ5F4K3bQ,"We showed up on a Saturday around lunch time. I was surprised it was still open for the day. Bonus! We were expecting it to be closed. The line wasn't super long but it was hot and muggy out. A very nice older gentleman was milling around though, offering water and lighthearted conversation while we waited under the Easy-Up with misters installed. All in all it took us about 20 minutes to get into the building. They really do their best to make your wait as comfortable as possible. Thank you LMB!

We finally made it indoors (thank god) to find a small counter and small eating area. Another gentleman who I assume is the owner was at the helm offering up samples and suggestions. We ordered the brisket and pulled pork, cheese grits, beans, and potato salad. Oink! Gladly paid with a debit card as a lot of mom/pop places only seem to take cash. Nice surprise. Made our way to an indoor table and chowed down. 

The brisket was really good. I'm sad though that 1/3 of my portion was mostly fat. I know a lot of meat fans are into that but it creeps me out. So I usually cut it off and hand it over to the BF. This stuff was so tender I literally had to use a spoon to eat it. I couldn't keep it on my fork! The pulled pork was very delicious. Not much flavor, but subtle. Not a dry piece of meat on our plate (we shared). Their sauces are the best I've tasted, I tried all three that were on the table. Grits were great, beans undercooked for my liking but great flavor, and the potato salad was my favorite. 

This isn't a place I'd frequent in the summer months. By the time we got to our table I was a sweaty miserable mess. Indoors is only slightly cooler than outside. The tables and sauce bottles were filthy and everything felt grease covered. I've never ate anywhere that made me immediately want to go home and shower before I continued with the rest of my day. 

I think the temperature is something I personally have an issue with, I don't blame LMB. So really, the only complaints would be that things need to be wiped down more often. The sauce bottles were just caked in half dried/half sticky sauce. It was gross. Also I feel it's a little overpriced for the portion but not so much that I wouldn't return. Just not as often as I'd prefer. 

A solid BBQ place with really great people working it.",4,2014-09-13 15:09

The boys also enjoyed the bottled beer $1.95 special, and I had a hot caramel macchiato (so delicious... there was a hint of cinnamon or hazelnut or something- overwhelming goodness!)  My brother picked up some cookies, which they admit are not made in house, and they were also delicious.  They had more of a cookie DOUGH goodness to them, rather than a baked cookie flavor/texture.

Now for those that haven't been here yet (first off, you're missing out), it's kind of like Chipotle but for BBQ -- you choose whether you want a sandwich or a platter (pro tip: get the platter! You get more meat and two sides... more food? yes, please! Where could you possibly go wrong?!). I was super hungry so I was somewhat seeing tunnel vision and chose the brisket (and, because the 3/3 staff members that I asked recommended it, I ordered the sliced brisket rather than the pulled/shredded...  and they did not steer me wrong). For the sides, I chose the baked beans and mac 'n cheese. The baked beans are good, just a bit bland and seem to be missing something -- maybe some kind of seasoning... just can't put my finger on it -- maybe salt? Not sure. The mac 'n cheese tho... yum! It's so delish! As for the sauce, I chose spicy, 'cause I like to add a bit of spice to my life, and also my lunch. 

The brisket... oh.em.gee! Literally melts in your mouth! I couldn't even hold it up on my fork; it kept falling off (that's how you know it's oh so good and cooked to perfection!) And the spicy BBQ sauce is so darn good -- perfect kick of heat, with the sweetness expected from BBQ sauce to compliment the brisket. It's like a match made in BBQ/brisket heaven. The mac 'n cheese was devoured within minutes, and the beans, eh... I may opt for coleslaw next time quite honestly.  

I will absolutely be back to get Naked again (teehee) -- the food is amazing, and it's around the corner so it's extremely convenient! :) Welcome to the neighborhood, Naked BBQ... I'm sure we'll be seeing each other a lot more often.",4,2017-05-30 22:44

The interior has NYC themed subway markings, street signs, and even apartment windows. Sure, it's a little cliche, but its nice that its a casual place with great food.  This place is family friendly and their servers always make my 4 yr old daughter feel welcome.  They have always accommodated our weird requests.  She loves pepperoni and we regularly request a side dish of the stuff.  They send out a ton for us and it makes her so happy!

NYPD has NYC style pizza that is large, soft, and reasonably thin.  It's best eaten by folding in half, of course.  This is easily my favorite style, even through I enjoy brick oven thin crust and Chicago style.  I will say that most times I simply order a slice or 2 of cheese pizza and venture off to pizza heaven.  The sauce and cheese are great and the quality speaks for itself with the first bite.  That being said, I've tried almost all the specialty pizzas here and really enjoy all of them.  The Pesto, The Big Kahuna, and Margherita are all favorites with my family.

I clearly pay extra to go here vs. other pizza joints, but I happily part with my hard earned money for a slice of NYPD pizza and a cold beer.  Speaking of which, they have a great selection on tap and in bottle.  I've always been able to find something I like and they even have some AZ local beers to try.

Large, mature trees line long fields with a pretty view of the south mountains. A quaint ""farm"" setting with small gardens and little shops in shabby chic buildings. 

You park across the street in a dirt/rock lot. Once you wander across the street, there is a cute little shack type set up, you walk in, grab your fresh made, plastic packed items. They have fresh and hearty salads with your choice of gourmet dressings, choices of sandwiches on artisan breads, delicious muffins and cake slices, all made right there. There are really cute miniature pies that look great, as well as fresh made lemonades that are really good. 

You get your sandwiches (fresh made) in a little picnic basket, after you pay. Grab a seat in the fenced in garden and enjoy the views and the weather (if it's not too hot out). Many people bring their pups and enjoy a walk around the farm.

We were greeted and seated immediately. The decor I must say is very different but nice. I was fascinated by their lamp shades. ( I know silly but hey I was) We started out with the crusty bread and olive oil however we had no plates, but we dug in anyway (an let me just say this was some damn good bread) Our waitress was like hmm would you guys like some plates for your bread? Hmm yes please ( ya think) lol  We all ordered something different from the sweet potato tortelli, yum, the turkey sloppy joe, which had a slight kick but not as spicy as you would think, fish and chips, and of course my dish which was black mussels with pommes frites. OMG! My dish was actually on the appetizer menu and let me just say I was in heaven when my dish arrived. It had the most mussels I have have ever had and the fries were just perfect.

I liked it so much that I am contemplating going back ASAP just to have some more, so yes it was that good. A word to the wise, if you order a side of chicken let it be known that it will be a small portion for $4.00. A very small portion. (that is all)

Years later we decided to return. It was a good thing. Since it was happy hour, my wife and I took advantage of the $5 menu. The flatbread was not very good but the lettuce wraps, calimari and potstickers definitely we're worth the order. Unfortunately, we ordered too much. These are generous portions.  I took the easy route and had wine.  My wife had water.  This is a good deal. I think we need to come back for the regular menu: prices seem reasonable and there are several interesting choices.",4,2016-07-20 3:44

Ladies and gentlemen, your newest member of Phoenix's local restaurant community: The Main Ingredient Ale House & Cafe. 

When I heard TMI was opening last night, I knew I had to go immediately as my work is very soon going to keep me away from Phoenix a lot over the next few months. I wanted to at least check it out now so I'll remember to go again during those brief periods that I'm back. 

I was greeted warmly as soon as I walked in by Courtney, who along with her husband Matt are the co-owners. I took a look around the main part of the restaurant - not too many major changes of the interior from its Lisa G days, but still a great vibe. And a De La Soul poster! Word. 

I then headed towards the bar, sat down and introduced myself to Matt, who I could tell was stoked about his first full day open. The bar itself was full of regular folks from the neighborhood and other local business owners who were there to chip in their support. A nice selection of microbrews on tap in front of me, and on the back shelf an array of wine and a vintage Schiltz statue holding up a lighted globe. 

I took a look at the menu and noticed both carnivorous and vegiforous options, with everything around $10 or under. Desserts included 3 flavors from Crave ice cream (their neighbor) and offerings from the Arizona Cheesecake Company (Mark and Courtney told me that they wanted to keep everything as local as possible). 

I saw Ayesha S.'s chile mac n' cheese, which looked great and she gave it her thumbs up of approval. Alas, with my doc-prescribed food restrictions, I had to limit myself to just a couple of things. I started off with a bowl of olives ($3) and then had the Winner salad ($9) which included mixed greens, turkey, egg, strips of salami, and some others items which at the moment I've forgotten. The olives were strong - a lot of  garlic and spice - which I was fine with but wasn't sure how others would take it. The salad was great, although I had to pick out the salami (thanks, doc). Someday I'll be able to eat the whole thing, along with the rest of the menu (hopefully).

To drink I had two glasses of wine - a cab and a zin. I'm only supposed limit myself to one glass, but as TMI was brand new and I'd eaten rabbit food all day and was having a good time, why the hell not. Both glasses were great, and I also got a small taste of a brand new concoction by Matt -  a rich, chocolatey porter ale with raspberry-infused vodka. Tasted like liquid dessert. Too bad I can't really order it moving forward but Matt's got a winner on his hands.

In terms of music, old school hip-hop beats and other phat tunes. Matt and I are the same age so I was appreciating each track that came on (Tribe, Digable, etc. Hell, even PM Dawn! Whatever happened to those guys?).  Volume was just right. 

As the evening wound to a close, I was able to talk to the owners further - about their plans for the place, their back story, on opening a new business - and really felt great that this house just off 7th Street is  in the hands of a young, energetic couple ready to make their own imprint on the Coronado neighborhood as well as Phoenix in general. 

Best to their success.

4 stars for now (come on, it's Day 1).

Yes the portions are small, but the price is so low that is truly great value, plus you end up getting more variety and can experiment a little more.  

I see the best value in the Salmon or Tuna Nigiri, because it is only $1 per order.  

If you preferred the americanized Las Vegas Rolls and Philly Rolls the price doubles all the way to $2.  Still a great value....

For the veterans who love sushi and eat Uni and Natto, you can order them, but they usually jump up to $3 and only made when you order them.    

Yes there is conveyor belt which turns a lot of sushi snob friends off, but I don't mind.  Plus, I end up ordering directly from the sushi makers if I don't see what I want on the belt.  

It isn't fine dining, but it is great value.

Service is a little rough....thus only 4 stars.  This place always seems to be understaffed.  Just be vocal and you get what you need.....

My japanese wife and I come about 1 per month and see outstanding value.

It is always busy at peak hours, so you are best to go a little before or after peak lunch or dinner times.",4,2011-10-05 16:45

I think watching them and how they interacted with the customers was one of the best aspects of our experience. They were kind and courteous and very attentive. The owner was talking and asking how our food was and he is a super friendly and honest person which sets a nice precedent for a healthy business. 

In terms of the food I like the fact that they leave off the sauce to give us the full meat experience. I liked the ribs and pulled pork. Sauce wise, the sweet sauce was probably my favorite. The spicy takes a bit to get that burn feeling but pretty good as well. The brisket was tender which was nice as well. We did get a couple of hard to chew pieces. Personal opinion is that the brisket was overseasoned with salt on the outside. Sides wise, slaw was good, potato salad was ok. I like that they served broccoli with garlic. Their mac and cheese needs work. It was pretty much pasta in cheese soup. The corn bread was not overly sweet but a bit small to my liking. Overall I would return if I needed a close by BBQ fix",4,2017-07-02 16:43

I love the way it's set up, and I'm not kidding when I say everything there looked good. I couldn't decide what I wanted, even after skimming through all the other reviews, so I finally winged it and just said ""What are your three most popular? I'll have those.""

Blueberry streusel, Oreo cheesecake, and a Reese's donut were the three I got, that were distributed between myself and two coworkers. I got the Reese's one. The overwhelming feedback was DELICIOUS! Slightly more cake like in texture than a typical fluffy easily deflated donut, creative flavors, and did I mention delicious?

Since I did not personally try the Oreo cheesecake and blueberry streusel, I can't really speak much on them. Overall, though, I really enjoyed the Reese's. The cake like texture was fine with me, though I did find the actual donut part a little lacking in flavor. Toppings were little peanut butter cups. Totally worth the sugar high and ultimately, the crash.

The line moved quickly, and everyone was friendly and helpful. The only one thing I was a little ""meh"" about was the packaging. They have boxes for the higher quantity orders, but my three donuts were plopped inside a brown paper bag and I was afraid they'd get melted or smushed together on the ride back. A box would be greatly appreciated for safe keeping.

Overall though, it's worth checking Hurts Donuts out. I'm already thinking of what I'll get next time I have a craving!",4,2017-10-05 18:50

Some people have compared this place to Chipotle or Subway.  Ignore them.  Yes, the food may be ""fast,"" but this is not a fast food joint.  I've always associated fast food with bad food.  This food is not that.

I've had the soups and the enchiladas.  I really don't think you can go wrong with what you order here.  From what I've seen, the more things you ask for, the better it tastes.  I always say yes to all the sauteed veggies, goat buttermilk sauce (I think that's what the white stuff is? okay, maybe not, but it's something like that), and additional garnishes they recommend.  You end up with a juicy, delicious enchilada piled high with all the extras that really make Mexican food sing.  They'll ask you the same questions about your bowl of soup.  It all tastes good in the soup.

Just say yes to everything they recommend and thank me later.",5,2016-10-03 18:48

I had reservations, so even though it was busy, we were actually seated 15 prior to my reservation time. The atmosphere was as I expected, although I was a little surprised that some people dressed more casually than I would have expected. 

The service was excellent. The waiter took our drink order and brought a loaf of bread that came with two spreads - both were excellent! One friend and I ordered the petite filet mignon, which was served with Fleming's potatoes. My other friend ordered the regular sized filet mignon with a baked potato. I have never seen a larger potato. My two friends each had a salad - one Caesar and house salad. The salads were each around $9, but good size. The regular filet mignon was $32, while the petite with the potatoes was $26. I didn't really think the regular size was that much larger than the petite. 

The steak was phenomenal! I ordered it medium and I can't recall a better steak that I have ever had. It was cooked well, excellent flavor and the perfect size.  The server continued to fill our drinks, brought a second loaf of bread and made sure we had everything we needed.

The total of 3 diet drinks, 2 salads, a baked potato, 1 regular filet mignon and 2 petite filet mignons with the included Fleming potato was $135. Not bad for 3 people. I will definitely come back again.",5,2010-01-31 17:03

Only thing I would recommend they consider is to make the menu board easier to read. Everything is a bit convoluted and difficult to read what's what. This make you miss out on other meals because 1) you can't read everything and 2) you feel pressured because people are waiting behind you.

Were they giving away free food? The dining room looked like a school cafeteria...why would so many people be here. I then caught a whiff of the food...mmmm! Hopped in line and then started to decipher the menu posted on the wall. I was a little confused. Jade Red chicken Quesadilla? Jerk Chicken Burrito? Why had I not thought of Chinese food in a burrito before?! Mind blown! Ordered both of these in a combo form which were accompanied by pork fried rice. The Jerk chicken was quite spicy, but  full of flavor. The jade red chicken had good balance and was probably the one I enjoyed more of the 2.

LRzA1JvTslVvK_zmYaF4yg,HCKZEpXv8CNdYLepoSMlDQ,wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw,"I need to preface this review by stating that I am not experienced in Indian cuisine, having eaten at one Indian restaurant in my life, as a child in Toronto. So this was something pretty new to me, which is surprising since we consider ourselves foodies and enjoy many foreign tastes. Admittedly, I didn't have any legit reasons for staying away from Indian food,and my wife finally got me to take her out for some. 
We tried Taj Mahal because we got a coupon in the mail - goes to show how a little marketing can go a long way. Our other choice would have been Tandoori Times, which we saw featured on ""Check Please"", but the coupon ended up being the deciding factor. 
We chose to try the lunch buffet. Our understanding is that when they opened a year ago, they pulled they buffet because it was so slow in the summer, but now it is back. 
We showed up at 1pm and were the only guests there, which made me a little nervous. The buffet was tucked away in a side room, with not the greatest presentation. It wasn't very inviting. Those worries were quickly assuaged by the food itself! My biggest gripe ended up being that the plates stacked for the buffet were not all clean - some still had food crusted on it. I had to go through the stack to pick out the cleanest plate. If I was the manager there, I would put a little more focus on ""dressing up"" the buffet, just for the sake of visual appeal, make it more inviting. And always have clean plates lol. 
I started with some rice and then sampled every offering in the buffet - there was a variety featuring crispy fried veggie balls, spinach paneer, tikka masala, curry chicken, lamb vindaloo, lentils, tandoori chicken, and a few others. 
Plain and garlic Naan were brought to our table, separate from the buffet.
All the food was excellent! The meat was tender, and the sauces were delicious. I went back 2 more times to help myself to a few of the items I really enjoyed (which was almost all of them lol). In particular, the lamb vindaloo stood out - it was so savoury and tender.
For me the weakest link in the buffet was the tandoor chicken - the chicken legs themselves were not that great, too fatty and mushy. But everything else was really fantastic!  Consider me sold on Indian food, I am ready to try more after eating at Taj Mahal. 
The service was also top notch - you can immediately tell this is family run. The owner came to our table to chat, and was very engaging and very proud of his restaurant. I imagine he visits every table and chats with all the guests, that just seemed to be the overall vibe. Other people trickled in as we dined, and some were already on a first-name basis with the staff. Always a good sign! By the time we left, the business had picked up a bit - I guess we showed up during a dead time of 30 mins or so, so in retrospect was not an issue. 
I took a peek at the menu before leaving, and it was pretty large, featuring all the meats, fish, shrimp etc cooked in every style possible. My wife confirmed that it was a pretty extensive Indian menu, she couldn't think of anything missing. The owner assured us that any dish can be ordered at any level of spiciness, accommodating all sorts of taste parameters. The buffet was noticeably toned down, which made sense, and to be honest was PERFECT for me - I didn't want anything too spicy or overly pungent. While it didn't challenge me, the buffet more than made up for that by being very homey and comforting. 
And that's the big takeaway from Taj Mahal.... I found this Indian food experience to be COMFORTING above all else. It seems more like eating at an Indian grandmother's kitchen, than a fancy restaurant that tries to ""elevate"" common dishes. Seems like they stick to the basics, without getting fancy, and do a fantastic job. For an Old Town Scottsdale establishment, it was not pretentious or arrogant - it was comforting and confident. 
While expanding my Indian food experience probably means trying other places, we definitely intend on returning to Taj Mahal to try their full menu after having enjoyed the buffet.",4,2018-01-25 21:41

I believe the original recommendation was about a weekend breakfast he had enjoyed. I finally had an opportunity to check it out at lunch time with one of my colleagues.

Ranch House Grille is just as cozy on the inside as it appears on the outside. And it's all perfectly in line with what you would expect in a breakfast/lunch type ""cafe"". More importantly, the atmosphere is relaxing and the dining room is clean.

Our server was very friendly too. It wasn't very busy, so I can only presume that the breakfast crowd must be their bread and butter. I hope I'm wrong, because the lunch menu is extensive. Ranch House Grille may only be open til 2:00, but the menu has several options that would satisfy any dinner cravings. In other words, I already know I want to come back for some breakfast... and ""dinner"".

Back to my lunch. I was in the mood for a simple burger and found a great option. The Crazy Bills was a single burger with blue cheese crumbles, bacon and lettuce, tomato & onion. The char-grille flavor is wonderful and the kitchen nailed the medium cook I requested. This was a delicious burger and the fries are excellent.

I knew what I was getting into because A) I've been to the original wineburger at 19th ave and Bethany Home already, B) I've read the reviews and C) I knew that these two places were originally started by a pair of brothers many years ago.

Walking in, its a real divey type place.  Wood paneling on the walls, simple no frill tables and chairs, with limited decorations and dimly lit.  It's set up exactly like its sister location the original wineburger, with half of it being a bar with chairs and tables, and the other half being a pool and congregating area for those that want to do more then sit and hang on the bar.  I also saw a pinball machine, which was pretty cool as well.

They have a few TV's hanging from the walls behind the bar with a variety of sporting events on for you to watch. Granted, I'm not a huge sports fan, but it's better then staring off into space or what not.  I sat at the bar, since I felt more comfortable there, and there wasn't to many people in here, so there was more then enough seating for me. I felt really comfortable here, and didn't feel like being around a million people anyways.

They have great beer and alcohol specials during happy hour, and they have a decent menu of items to choose from. Prices are great, and the bartender here was really super cool.  Him and I chatted throughout my meal and I really enjoyed the conversation.  I went with the Jumbo Hot dog, and it was tasty...charbroiled and all, I really liked it here.

People seem to flock here (follow the leader) because the place is busy - it's all open and can be seen and heard (with the ridiculously loud music) from five stores away in any direction. 

That would be great. IF THE FOOD WAS GOOD. It's below average quality.

The two times I went the hostess had the nastiest attitude too. No time for that with much better food within a hop, skip or jump. 

It's nice to see restaurants busy at Kierland, especially when some, like Ra, are moving. 

But it would be better if they were of higher quality, (clientele and quality of food).

Any restaurant that does not take reservations attracts a trashy crowd. Sadly, 95% or more of the crowd at Postino is trash.",1,2016-03-23 6:49

The location makes it hard to find and you'll want to experience this place when it's not too busy to get the full effect. It's on the smaller side and fills up fast.

Tonight I ordered the chicken yakatori to switch up my usual sushi binge. I had had it twice before. The sauce is AMAZING. Upon my last bite i found it sort of chewy so i spit it out. It was raw. I informed the owner and showed her the raw peice. She pointed out that I had eaten all of it. Like I would intentionally share 6 peices of chicken with my husband, knowing they were raw and eat them all? I said I wanted it removed from the bill, she again said I had eaten all of it. I work in a resturant. So does my husband. We never complain about food, we know what quality we are paying for to have such cheap sushi here. Our expectations are low but we are usually happy when we leave. We were very dissapointed in themanner that the manager took regarding to this very serious safety/health issue. I felt like she was accusing me of purposely eating all of the chicken and waiting until the last bite to complain. That's like saying I would intentionally eat raw chicken?  It was removed off the bill, after an insincere ""sorry"" was muttered to me by the owner. Grossed out I went next door to NYPD pizza to order a salad for dinner instead as my husband paid our remaining tab and  tipped the sushi chef. Working in this industry I know how these things happen. This resturant obviously does not practice safe food handling measures and I'm happy I atleast noticed,( even though it was at the end) that my food was undercooked.

i like this place. their menu is rather diverse with a bunch of things that look really good. sometimes you go these newer restaurants and they have a very limited menu, or the selection on the menu is just to weird. 

the breakfast was good and i am def open to trying more items. had the pork tostada, which was a bit overwhelming but really good if you are into a more ""mexican-y bfast.""

for lunch, i had a sammich. good amount of meat. nothing totally outstanding but still a solid offering.

for my dinner trip, i went during happy hour and had a burger with sweet potato fries. both were awesome. the med-rare burger could have used another 45 seconds on the grill; it was still a bit too red inside. the sweet pot fries were excellent, some of the best of this ""new"" trend.

First visit I tired a sandwich Besides being well overpriced for what you get to begin with a friend with me asked for a little Balsamic vinegar however that would be an up charge.  Sodas come in bottles so if you drink more and one it of course cost you more.   The food was not bad but I would not describe it as great either the bead was hard to bite through tough and grilled hard on the outside.  Second time I was sort of dragged back in we a group was headed to another place when everyone besides me was all wanting to go try it.  So I go in with intentions of spending a bit more for a pasta dish remembering how I left hungry with a sandwich last time.  BAD IDEA I bought the Spaghetti very lack luster simple pasta and tomato sauce the noodles were cooked quite well but the sauce reminded me of that hunts canned sauce I use to by when I was on a tight budget fresh out of college.  Garlic bread.. oh wait I forgot no bread everything is up charged I didn't go past the 16 bucks I was already spending for the so so tiny portion of pasta I was already given and a soda. I figured I would be better off finding the vending machine in the office later for filler.

Bottom line for me Decent tasting food very small portions High prices will not return even if the group all decides that's where they are going again.  Why spend that much for lunch and still have to find something more to eat on the way back to the office?",2,2012-03-08 18:58

Oh it's ""too Irish"", ya say?! I love how un-modern this place is for an Irish pub . . . and those giant wooden kegs you can sit at! Don't need that flash and flare. Just give me the beer! 

Smithwicks on tap? Sold! Fabulous specials about every night of the week. Half off pints and appetizers Sunday, $5 burgers and $3 bottles of Guinness Black Lager on Monday nights.

There's plenty of other tap beers as well as a rotation of craft beers, some local. 

Try the Dirty Apple. It's a fusion of Guinness and an Irish cider. LOVED it. 

Whiskey on whiskey on whiskey. Forgot the bartender's name, but he was more than helpful this weekend when we asked for his favorite whiskey suggestions. Thanks, dude! 

The Bleu Burger is already fresh and flavorful; it's even better when you add bacon. The Corned Beef and Cabbage is the best I've had.

But some where in the year, I started inviting friends to meet me on the roof top for cocktails, or when I scored a pool pass, I would invite friends to join me at the pool to hang out and eat food, or I would bring my laptop and sip coffee and work.  

I've never been to a more welcoming establishment!  The one thing I will say about Cafe Tranquilo, and the Clarendon, in general, is that the staff goes above and beyond to give you the most amazing service possible. I could list so many instances in which their service was simply amazing, I will share 2.

My A/C broke last year.  I wasn't sure that it would be repaired that night.  I called and stopped by the front desk to see if they had rooms, explained I wanted to give the repair guys a little longer, but I might be back.  An hour later, I get a phone call from the Claredon's front desk asking if I was ok, and did I still want to come back.  I was shocked that they would take the time to call!  Fortunately, that night, the A/C guys had just notified me that they were about to switch my AC back on.  

I stopped in recently, and this inspired my review update....  I pull out my laptop to work in the lounge.  My server, Falyn, stops by to take my food order.  I say... ""Hmmm, I saw some one with cheese fries and chorizo the other day, I could go for something like that..."". Falyn simply said, ""if we have the ingredients, we can make it, no worries!  I'll bring that right out.  want anything else on it like sour cream?"".  Oh, and it was so delicious... so guilt-inducing delicious.  Those fries were the most amazing comfort food. 

 I'm sorry folks, but I go to a lot of restaurants, I co-host a supper club for Pete's sake, and it is rare that you find a restaurant that will go off script/menu for you like this!  Rare to find a hotel that will personally phone you, when you haven't actually confirmed a reservation, to let you know they were holding a room for you just in case.

I've gone to the Scottsdale and Lincoln location quite a few times, and have received nothing but stellar service each of those visits. Tonight, I cannot say the same about the Chandler location. 

Let's begin by Brittany (our server) coming to take our drink orders... It took close to 20 minutes (18 to be exact) to receive our drinks. We hadn't seen our server and was wondering where she had went, so we had asked a near by server if he can find out where Brittany was because our table was ready to order. Long story longer... A girlfriend of mine had ordered a $155 bottle of Caymus, the server had her sample it, and my girlfriend told the server the wine needed to be filtered. Brittany disregard what we had requested and poured it into a glass pitcher (can't think of the name for container she poured the wine in) and never came back. We finally had to tell the young gal that was helping Brittany serve the table we wanted the wine to be filtered because of the sediment. This gal kept challenging us... Stating why didn't we tell Brittany this in the beginning... And we told her we did, but she never came back to do it. Mind you, there was 3/4 of the bottle left, it was not like anyone drank the bottle and demanded anything for free. My boyfriend who is in the restaurant industry... A GM of a restaurant in North Scottsdale would not have let something like this slip without touching the table. No manager came to touch on the table as this was an on-going challenge of the night. This went on for the majority part of our visit until we watched the manager  go into the wine cellar with our other server to grab another bottle we had requested. 

Point is, no one touched the table. Despite of the challenge for the night with the wine, you would've at least expect a manager to come by because no one had taken responsibility for such poor service we left quite disappointed... Can't expect a decent tip if you do not receive decent service. I think holding yourself ACCOUNTABLE is a major issue at tonight's visit. No accountability whatsoever. I highly suggest someone in charge reading, 'Leaders Eat Last'. It's a great read on leadership. 

Tonight's visit left a really bad taste in my mouth. Very poor service! Brittany did not return to our table as she left it for the other gal to take care of us. I know how intimidating and frustrating it can be to serve, because I myself have served for 5 years while going through college, but at a place like Fleming's I don't see why you cannot be successful when all the tools you need are right in front of you. Being in the service industry isn't for everyone, it takes a lot of patience, and customer service skills. You work in this industry to be of at service to people no matter how bad a night is going.

Unfortunately for us, there are few. Fortunately for Bertha's, they are one of them and will surely capitalize on that for years to come. 

This place doesn't look like much on the inside or the outside but the food makes you forget all that superficial stuff right when it hits your eyes. I tasted the Thai Chicken Wrap and the Chicken Curry wrap and both were tasty, large, and well worth the cheap prices that we paid for them. The wraps even came with a perfect little cookie....not that I needed it because I had a huge Cream Cheese Fudge Brownie sitting in front of me!!!!!! 
This place was already good enough and then you add Cream Cheese Brownies, Candy Bar Brownies, Lemon Bars, Peanut Bar Brownies, Pumpkin Cheesecake, House Made Doughnuts....etc....you see where I am going with this. Their pastry/dessert selection is worth stealing out of your Grandmother's purse for. And you won't need to take much, everything is affordable if not cheap.

If I remember correctly, as soon as you enter you head down a flight of curly stairs (thus, the Salt CELLAR). I believe you're supposed to have a reservation, but we just walked on in and asked if we could be seated.

Seating was a little strange but we got over it. The place is strange in general, so if you're looking for ""normal"" you should probably save this for a later date. We sat in a tiny room with another family on the opposite end. The lighting is very dim and romantic, and the entire feel is very ""couple-sy"", so you should probably steer clear if you're going through a breakup.

Our server was a straight up Lobster connoisseur. She broke that puppy into beautiful savory little pieces in seconds flat, leaving us with the shell in tact (probably so that we could revel in how much better she was able to do it than we ever would have been, which we did).

We went all out and had the full course meal, complete with paired glasses of wine. It was quite the pricey treat, but it was worth it.

Noteworthy appetizer: The oysters are absolutely heavenly. I have only ever eaten oysters previously at Casey Moores Oyster House, so it was nice to be able to try them somewhere else... but there was no comparison, Salt Cellar's oysters far exceeded my expectations.

We decided to try this place based on the recommendation of another long-time friend.  We decided to meet up at 5:30 and the place was already packed.  I was able to score a table outside on the patio....no frills but very pleasant.  Our waitress took the time to explain the menu to us, pointing out some of the more popular items and I told her of my quest for the perfect red sauce.  Best Bud arrived about one margarita in we commenced to catching up.  Chips were fresh and the salsa were both redolent with cilantro.  We shared a cheese crisp with hatch chiles on my half and it was really good.  Great tortilla and (of course) I adore cheese, so that was a good start.  We ordered entrees; my friend ordered the pollo fundido and I had a cheese enchilada with red sauce.  Now, we all know that I am on a perpetual quest for the perfect red sauce and bloody mary combo; I didn't have a bloody mary but the red sauce was good.  Not the best I've had but certainly up to snuff for a Phoenix native who NEEDS her Mexican fix from time to time.  So, to sum it up: nice casual ambiance, good (reasonably priced) food and drinks, friendly service, and a mellow group enjoying hanging out while waiting for a table adds up to a good time.

iuRn0I84ELt7oILjCiFjLQ,NnMN10F4wDuBKv25vCqcCg,pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA,"Shortly after posting my entry about Centurion (see below) I received an email from chef/owner Eric Osburn stating that the had, indeed, not been in the restaurant during our lunch because someone had set fire to their fence, and he was taking care of that. We had noticed the damage on our way in. He asked that we give Centurion another try.
Since, as I said in my review, there were many intriguing things about the place, we decided to do that.

     The patio had been repaired, and even improved on, with the addition of canvas ""sails"" overhead to block the sun. It was 2PM, there were few customers, and we were able to have a good conversation with Eric. He's a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park and is passionate about food. With Centurion, he wants to overturn many of the problems he's noticed in other restaurants. He aims to be high-end, but with reasonable prices and no pretension. His kitchen is right in back of the windows looking out on Roosevelt, so the cooks don't feel shut in. And like many chefs now, he tries to use local and sustainable products, making for a seasonal menu.
He even told me a great way to cook butternut squash - using a cider reduction and vanilla.

     The truly notable changes in our meal were with the stuffed mushrooms and the sauce that came with the mussels. Instead of being ugly lumps, the mushrooms were a work of art. They had been split, stuffed with rice, and wrapped in proscuitto. Looking like exotic oysters, they were so pretty I hated to cut into them. But I was glad I did, because this time they were perfectly cooked and delicious. The mustard sauce on the mussels was well balanced, with the flavors of mustard and white wine playing off each other. We kept soaking it up with the accompanying tasty house-made bread. I have to say I still wasn't crazy about the eggplant panini, but it was more thoroughly cooked than the last time. I guess it's just a matter of taste.

     Because it was Eric who served us, things went well. I'm willing to accept the fact that the staff had been upset about the fire and not functioning as well as they ordinarily would. We'll be going back to try the dinner entrees, so I guess we'll find out.",4,2010-10-20 18:09

I was a bit shocked by the phone call but also very grateful. 
Fleming's obviously takes their customer satisfaction very seriously and it made mew feel good knowing that time was taken to care about how I was feeling. 

Words cannot express how amazing our revisit was. 
Linda's service was impeccable and I would highly recommend asking for her section next time you go. 

I ordered the Mozzarella and Tomato salad, what a vision of loveliness it was (see pics) and it tasted just heavenly, the mozzarella melted in my mouth and the tomato's were so sweet and juicy along with that spicy basil I would have been happy just stopping there. 

For my entree I decided to try the Barbecue Scottish salmon Fillet.........WOW!! 
Absolutely incredible! This is bar far the best item I've ordered here and is now my new favorite. (see pics) It's sweet and slightly crisp BBQ glaze had me yearning for more. 

Now I haven't ordered mashed potatoes from Flemings in years since they took their horseradish mashed potatoes off the menu, but let me tell you after trying their Parmesan peppercorn mashed potatoes I soon forgot my long lost favorite, these ones were to die for!!! 
Perfectly creamy, thick , buttery and seasoned to perfection I will be ordering these from now on most definitely! 

My husband's usual order of chipotle mac and cheese and a medium rare fillet was no exception to the excellence, he reveled in every bite! 

What a total surprise it was when Linda brought him a Creme' Brulee with a candle to re-celebrate his Birthday! 
That my dear friends is attention to detail and absolutely made us feel very special and quite frankly made our night!

7Li1En_gP0wyZ2PdzQISnA,p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,QS3QxI7u5PRdtbGgI0-UsA,"As a foodie, cook and native Arizonan, I've always had this strange misconception about eating fish and seafood in a landlocked state. My mindset was simply this, don't do it. You see it only took that one bad experience from years ago and I've held ever single seafood restaurant accountable since. With the passage of time and through technology, modern shipping and refrigeration methods the life of fresh fish and seafood has been greatly extended. So much so that my attitude towards eating fish has turned around completely and now I crave it.

While fish was exiled from my life, Sakana sushi was quietly building a mini sushi empire of Japanese restaurants. Since opening their first in 1996 they've continued to expand and now with 4 valley locations, it won't be hard to get your sushi fix without breaking the bank, especially at lunch time. 

Each day Sakana offers several different daily creations and specials in addition to the 15 or so items on their standard lunch menu. Between you and me, go for one of the daily specials. These lunch plates are massive and will satisfy the most famished of appetites. You'll see exactly what I mean if you order up the Chicken Maturi ($8.99). A whole chicken breast pounded out into 2 thin slabs, breaded and deep fried until golden and crunchy is then dressed with a slightly sweet soy sauce. Oh and that's not all, along side is a salad of mixed greens and a half of a crab filled California roll. You will not leave hungry.

Along with a happy upbeat greeting when you arrive at Sakana, Miso soup comes standard just as soon as you sit down; talk about an efficient lunch service. For a light snack to accompany the soup I also enjoy ordering Edamame ($3.25); steamed soybeans sprinkled with salt, that are as much fun to say as they are to eat.

Many people do not understand the difference between sushi and sashimi. This is actually really easy; sushi refers to the vinegar cooked rice while sashimi refers solely to the fish itself. To see the difference first hand, order the Sakana Lunch ($9.99). Thin slices of sashimi; raw salmon, tuna, shrimp, albacore and house smoked salmon are placed on top of sushi; rice. Served on a wooden board, a California roll and a rotating fried item accompany the special. 

If you're dieting and trying to watch your starch intake, Id highly recommend trying the Sashimi Deluxe ($11.99). Not only do you get a crispy salad but a platter filled with a delicious combination of sliced salmon, tuna, albacore and hiramasa aka Australian King Yellow Tail. However this line up isn't set in stone as the chef will change these out with what's available any given day. What you can take for granted is the freshness and quality of each type of fish served.

For the price, Sakana is hard to beat, though for peace of mind, I would have gladly paid more.",4,2011-04-03 1:19

Yes there is a long wait, meh, once you try the food you will have forgotten you waited.

To start off..THEY HAVE BIG RED IN CANS! (if you know BBQ or TX then you get it)

The fatty brisket is juicy and tender. I had it both off the plate and on a piece of white bread. You have to get the brisket WITH FAT, because the fat gives extra flavor. If you are avoiding the fatty brisket because you are watching what you eat then you have no business in a BBQ joint. It defeats the purpose of the food and flavor. 

The pork ribs were delicious. My boyfriend picked up a rib and it just slid off the bone. Slid. off. the. bone! They were packed with flavor and just a little bit of smokey flavor that separates it from the competition. 

As far as sides go, I got the Cheddar Jalapeno Grits and Potato Salad. I could not stop eating the Potato Salad. It wasn't super creamy which takes away from the potatoes, it was divine.. The grits were very good, although with the weather in Phx and the misters that were on the patio the grits became slightly gelatinous. But that was only because i neglected them once I focused on the meat. 

The BBQ sauces were so good although the meat is juicy enough that you dont need too much of it. 

I loved that the owner would walk around asking how things were. He is such a nice guy who loves what he does which reflects in his food/these reviews. Service was so friendly and I was sure to shake the hand of the man who created such an fantastic establishment.",5,2015-06-01 19:32

I mean, a conveyor belt is super fun, but raw fish riding around the restaurant without any refrigeration is a scary notion. 

I am not a fish person, so I stick to shrimp and krab/crab (yes, I know krab is pressed fish.. ) and didn't try any of the fish rolls, but everyone else at the table mentioned that their rolls were all fishy.

Fishy fish is a sign that it isn't very fresh.

A lot of people complained about the service...I didn't think it was particularly bad. You would get the same type of service at any other buffet-type restaurant.

bhnoHzprdwS7ASyE-jMtZA,zFYs8gSUYDvXkb6O7YkRkw,cs1qJvnWUg_f8g020z_3PQ,"Ah, I remember the first time I went to Pizzeria Bianco.  A group of us went to their downtown Heritage Square location and ordered every pizza and antipasto on the menu.  The one I fell in love with was the Rosa.  Rosa stole my heart.  So it's been quite a few good years since I last visited Pizzeria Bianco and we decided to stop by last night to rekindle the romance with Rosa and a Wiseguy.

Rosa (Red onion, parmesan, rosemary, AZ pistachios), $16:  Did you not read the description?  This pizza is DIVINE!  That parmesan is salty and granular so don't be expecting any cheese drag action.  I love the crunch the pistachio gives and that rosemary is subtle but fragrant.  This isn't your typical pizza and I love it.

Wiseguy (Wood-roasted onion, house smoked mozzarella, fennel sausage), $19:  The Wiseguy is everything you want in a pie.  The house-made mozzarella is so delicious and the fennel sausage is a flavor explosion.  Still a straight-forward and simplistipic pie that'll have your skirt flippin'!

This Biltmore location is decent.  It's bigger and more spacious but the service isn't so great.  The staff is more interested in talking to each other than checking on your meal.  I think I like the original Heritage Square location more.

What else can I say?  Chris Bianco is brilliant.  It's no wonder how he has won a James Beard Foundation Award for best Southwest Chef and no small feat that Pizzeria Bianco is named one of the best pizzerias in the country by Bon Appétit.  So come and get some pizza!  You won't be disappointed.",4,2017-02-15 20:16

It wasn't too expensive either, $30 or so for two 14 inchers and a large Cesar salad. We got a Hawaiian and a simple peperoni. Both were tasty, not out of this world, but good. The Cesar was very good, love the dressing. 

We also had a cocktail while we waited for our order. It was a little difficult to get a drink, the bar was packed so we flagged down a waitress to take our order, took a few minutes, but finally we got our drinks. I got a Bellini, looked amazing! tasted good too, but it was strong so I couldn't finish it, as our food arrived a few moments later. 

In the past I remember them having great salads and very yummy aps, like the BOMB dip and cheese bread, a few walked by us and I seriously regretted not order them to go as well. 

A few tips, if you are going for dinner get there with time to spare and have a cocktail on the patio while you wait for your table, they pretty much always have a wait, but the misting system out there is nice. Also, the cookie dessert is amaze-ballz! Get one for sure! Order it early though, it takes awhile to make.",3,2012-07-24 17:49

Clearly Oregano's is not a one-of-a-kind gourmet restaurant, but it is definitely worth a visit or two. I usually prefer my non-chain, mod style central Phoenix restaurants, but I am not above a good old Oregano's dinner. 

I have been to quite a few of their locations around the city, but the Camelback location is my personal favorite. Obviously, it's a quick hop from my place, but it also has a more diverse crowd (which makes for excellent people-watching) and a friendlier atmosphere. The servers always seem to remember us when we sit down...which is quite welcoming and makes me feel extra special. Speaking of servers, Oregano's has some of the best around. I don't know what they do when they hire for these places, but every Oregano's seems to have the most helpful, attentive servers. I don't know if I've ever had bad service here.

I have to admit that the food, although not always the highest in quality, is pretty tasty. As many people before me have said, the portions are huge, which always makes me feel wasteful. I really love getting the Big Ol' Ravioli, which is literally a giant ravioli covered in mozzarella. The Boom Dip must be ridiculously unhealthy, but it is also quite appetizing. The pizzas are good, but don't taste especially fresh. They're no Cibo Margherita.... The food usually has good flavor, but there are times where I have been disappointed. Another regular choice of mine is the Dirty Monkey cocktail. It's fairly strong, but quite delicious. I have to admit that I am a complete sucker for their Pizza Cookie; so good! It's a great dessert to get if you can share it with a few friends. 

Unfortunately, there is practically always a wait and it sometimes seems to last forever. Especially if you're standing in 100 degree weather or if it's a chilly evening. The hosts sometimes bring around little samples of pizza and offer drinks while you're waiting, which I enjoy. Over all, I wouldn't say that Oregano's is the most original restaurant, but the food makes most people happy and it's a fun place to spend an evening.",3,2011-01-21 5:46

Il Bosco
It's a fresh bite to scream up my Yelp
It switched up the beat to my heart
That's right it brought imported cheese to the boulevard
And that's right, it's the one who's firewood oven to start 

Il Bosco
It's a place y'all love to date
It's a place that's raised the stakes
I told Yelp Phoenix there's no debate
I'm back with an appetite cause it's Bosco


Il Bosco Pizza is a locally own spot quaint and popping with some firewood cooked pizza; this place definitely has a lovely charm to it.  

I came on a rainy evening so the place inside was packing!  I would say the inside seats a max of 35 people including the bar.  The open kitchen where you can see the firewood oven was an allure while chef craft his work.  

We started with a bottle of wine plus some Fried Ravioli.  The ravioli came along with some sweet marinara sauce and had a decent soft doughiness to it.  Next we shot for the Caprese Salad; which was my favorite.  It came with Burrata cheese along with the traditional Mozzarella cheese, tomato, and balsamic.  Overall, one of my favorite bites of the night.  Fluffy burrata along with smooth and stringy mozzarella cheese ending with a sweet balsamic punch.  

For our pizza we ordered their Biaggia & Carmela.  The Biaggia came with prociutto, fig jam, four cheese, and arugula.  Overall, a decent bite but I felt the arugula was over-powering.  The fig jam was light and I wish they would put more on it.  The Carmela came with tomato sauce, sausage, spinach, and caramelized onions.  The tomato sauce was a welcoming pairing with the saltiness of the sausage and sweet onions.

In the end, Il Bosco Pizza is a little sweet spot for some farm to table pizza.  Traditional Italian bites with some allure of the ambiance.  The firewood oven is awesome to watch, but not sure how well it fares during the summer months. - Enjoy!",4,2018-03-19 17:28
#NAME?,rMsB82tk9uOB6JumPMgczg,ddLH_-W5Gr9Az4M5Xo981w,"In honor of my YFF being today's ROTD holder, I declare an end to my review hiatus.

Thailicious has sat motionless in my bookmarks for months, ever since mon ami Kristin J first alerted me to its existence.  The name alone evokes images of ""superlicious delish"", as the superlicious Mary A states.

The characters in this screenplay are as follows...
Joyce W - my YFF and international essay contest winner, who I shall refer to as J-WoW.  If you want to read an actual well written review, check hers out.
Linh L - one of today's top talents in beat-boxing, who I shall refer to as Mr Peanut.  If you want to read an actual amusing review, check his out.
Brett B - the author of this autobiography, who I shall also refer to as Mr Peanut
The Waitress - who I shall refer to as Flo

As an author, whose responsibility it is to convey an experience to you, the reader, I hope you'll be able to take away this... I arrived AND checked in prior to either J-WoW or Mr Peanut!

After 'handshakes & hugs', we gangsta strolled up into that beyaaaa...ah.  What a sight it must have been.  Two of us could have passed for cast members from the Asian version of Melrose Place, while the third closely resembled Zippy the pinhead.

We were promptly ushered to a booth with what appeared to be vinyl seats, and I make this distinction to inform the reader that as I scootched myself across the bench, an inopportune vibration was simulcast from the vicinity of my pants bottom.  Not wanting to appear like a wind-talker in front of my co-diners, I made an effort to replicate the sound by continuing my side-glide until successive audible vinyl rubs were rendered.  But no such vindication was attained...

My companions were a true delight.  Dear reader, may you be blessed with your own J-WoWs and Mr Peanuts.  Lunch doesn't always have to just be about binging on 1800 calorie entrees.  Open your heart, and your heart may just open you back.

I ordered the Pad See Ew, vegetarian style as a nod to my girl Cici F.  Now, I'm down with PSE, yeah, you know me.  It's my jam.  The dish gets my merkin a twerkin... however this one didn't have the je ne sais quoi of Thai Spices or Thai Rama, but that didn't dissuade me from a raucous display in which no less than half of the deadly sins were involved.

After putting in our dessert order, I asked Flo if she would be so kind as to provide me with a spoon, say... eighteen or nineteen inches in length.  Now here's the kicker.  She looked at me like I was a damned fool.

That delightful Thai Tea Creme Brulee dessert proved to be the meal's Swan Song. It boasted a sun kissed glow that could have passed for San Diego's own TM, a consistency smoother than my girl MC J, and was reminiscent of everything that's right about pumpkin pie without the benefits of high protein or dietary fiber.  How is no one singing its praises?

[Chorus - Nicki Minaj, J-Wow & Mr Peanut:]
Flo, I got this short-azz spoon in my hand
Beating like a drum on a treat that's all tanned
Can't you taste that creme, bacreme, creme, creme, bacreme, bru, lee?
You got that creme brulee
creme, bacreme, creme, creme, bacreme, bru, lee
Yeah, that's the creme brulee

I ordered the Duroc Pork Tomahawk - very tender and full of flavor, not to mention a cool dish to look at. The beans that came with it were even better!

I had heard a lot about the salted caramel pudding so even tho we were really full from dinner, we ended up getting that. I would say that this was the best part of the entire meal.

Pull pork is not what I expected, not enough smoke & it tastes like corn beef (probably good during St. Patty's after couple of beers) yes it's that bad lol!. 2. The ranch style beans I had, had to much shredded meat in it, like where's the beans huh? 3. Coleslaw was too dry. 4. No fresh brewed ice tea! & $2 bottle water! 5. Beef ribs is only served on Fridays & Saturdays. Onto the positives. 1. Sausage had a excellent TX taste. 2. Beef brisket was mouth watering even the leanest part wasn't dry like other places, a true TX taste!. 3. Pecan Pie was good. I suggest avoiding the pull pork.

The Dragon Palace is tucked away in the corner of an older strip center on the east side of N 32rd just north of E Thunderbird.  It looks like it's been here for years, and I mean a lot of years...  But don't let deter you from trying the Dragon Palace!

Restaurant~ the decor is old.  It's is a thrown back into the late seventies and early eighties with huge red vinyl booths with the high backs.  The walls are solid blue (I guess as a contrast maybe?) with some Asian inspired borders and prints.  They have those old Asian lamps hanging for the ceiling.  Although this place is a through back into time of another era, the place is very clean and comfy.  

Service~ excellent from when you enter their restaurant until you leave.  5 star service.

Food~ all of their lunch meals come with water and hot tea, complimentary.  They also offer the usual beverage choices if you so desire something else.  The hot tea was very good!  

Their menu is also a through back to old Asian restaurants I used to go to when I was a kid.  I remember when mom would say ""we are going to go and eat Chinese"" and I would say ""mom, we're not cannibals do you mean Asian or Chinese food?""  

After a slap on the back of the head we were off ~ ready to get stuffed since they always brought you way too much food.

All of their lunch meals here at the Dragon Palace come with a very tasty bowl of egg drop soup (thick and tasty!), wontons, egg roles, rice is fried or steamed  and the main entree.  We had their Beef with Broccoli and their Mongolian Beef.  Both dishes were China-licious!!  Our entire meal was less than $20 with the tip!

I'm looking forward to going ""Back in Time"" at he Dragon Palace again real soon.  Hopefully I will see you there.",4,2011-10-06 0:09

Kept it simple and ordered the #1, which was a single burger with cheese and all the fixings, a very generous portion of french fries, and a drink for $8.47.  The food was all delicious, fries were crisp and seasoned well.  The staff was friendly and my order to go was ready in just a few minutes.  

The fries weren't piping hot when I got them which means they were probably sitting for at least a short time but stayed crisp till I finished them, and were seasoned really well.  The price point on the single burger and fries combo is probably $1-$2 higher than Lucky's but all in all I'd come back and would love to try one of the speciality burgers.",4,2017-01-20 21:51

It just didn't seem like the food here turned over very fast because there were not that many people there.  The sushi was dry and not very tasty and the plates that had the individual slices of tuna, salmon and other fish had plastic wrap on them and made it impossible to get any.  The crab legs were so water logged that I had to dump the water off of my plate.  Just not very good or worth the money.  The service was good and the waitress was on top of everything.

the interior decor is super cute...almost like a 50's diner! they have a cozy, refreshing patio, which is where we parked for our meal. 

so we heard about these brussel sprout nachos? they are the bees knees! i kid you not, they are absolutely delicious. they are a great app for 4 people or a meal for 1. the cheese, brussel sprouts, and chili rings all go together with the delicious chips. 

i had the playa poke for my entree. the chipotle aioli was ok. i'd rather taste the fish than the sauce. next time i'd get something different. my dining companions loved their tacos, tataki and tulum poke. if you get the lettuce poke, be prepared for a hand-mess...it's hard to eat without a fork/spoon. 

i also ordered a side of fried plantains. sweet, crispy, and soft. cooked perfectly.

the one negative...the wife ordered a drink...it came in a coconut. basically it was 10 bucks for 2 sips. the inside of a coconut is small, and then they pack it with ice so essentially it was a bum deal.

I love authentic, affordable, and fresh Japanese food and Sushi Ken has been my number one choice for many years.

Not sure what changed, but in the last six months, my experience with this place is nothing but unpleasing and sour.

I understand they are busier than normal at times, but I waited for 30 min after being seated by the sushi bar to have my waitress bring me a menu and ask what I would like to drink. 

I also noticed their food and drink portion has decrease quite tremendously in the last few months. My friend's melon cream soda went from floating to half full. Curry Katsu went from full plate to there's barely any curry on the rice. And when I addressed my concern with the staff, her response to me was because they charge cheap  for the food ""since economy is bad and customers can use a break"" I understand they want to ""give us a break"" for our wallet, but what I saw was the portion taking a break.  

Once, there was a fish bone in our sushi that almost chocked my friend and when we kindly mentioned it to our waitress, she just walked away without even an apology.  

Also, be prepared for the wait if you decide to order some sushi/sashimi. Once my friend and I placed the orders at the same time. He got and finished his udon noddle and katsu rice way before I even see my first sushi roll.

Although more reminiscent of my strolls through New Orleans than Paris, French Grocery is a solid destination for fulfilling some of the finer, rarer cravings I've had.

Perhaps it's the chicory-infused coffee that feels reminiscent of my visits to NOLA's iconic Cafe du Monde. This spice, the taste of which I'd compare to anise or licorice, has roots in the 19th century. During coffee shortages, most notably in the civil war, it would be used to stretch the supplies. The trend stuck, and even today this particular type of blend persists in the area. On my next visit, I'll pair it with their famous beignets! 

The sweets are legit. I have only had a couple of the tarts so far, but they were delicious and affordable. For more savory baked goods, you can't go wrong with a ham and cheese croissant for breakfast It's surprisingly light, and you'll enjoy every bite. Since they open at 7am, it's a nice, peaceful spot to drop by during your morning commute!

Other noteworthy products include a small, but fancy cheese selection. The largest selection of all, of course, is the wine. I have only perused it, but look forward to indulging. 

French Grocery isn't French enough to please those missing ventures across the Atlantic. Ironically, it's not even resembling a grocery. Still, it remains a solid spot for any time of day. Dine in, and grab some goodies to go.",4,2016-06-16 5:03

After the pickle came the chicken and I can say with confidence that it's the best chicken I've had at a bar. It doesn't matter if you get the strips or the buffalo chicken sandwich, they are both mouthwatering (writing about it right now is making me hungry). That night I left really content and sure that I would be back, and not just late at night!

Once I returned I knew I should try a few other things but I'm always compelled to get the chicken. I did manage to taste the mac and cheese (with buffalo chicken!), their wings and the chicken parm. Everything was spectacular (especially as far as pubs go)!

The staff at Armadillo Grill has always been great and I'm sure they will continue to be as I wiggle my way into becoming a regular here! Great happy hour, great food and friendly service in a really chill bar equals two huge thumbs up from me (I jammed them so they're both swollen)!",5,2010-04-05 23:16

It's a weird occurrence when my wife feels like she didn't eat enough so you know the portions here are smaller. 

They have this communal dinning which is kinda like eating in an online chat room... yeah, not for me. So we decided to wait 45 minutes for a private table.

1 - The food didn't take so long. There was no one in front of me and it took 19 minutes.

2 - If they actually got my order right. Note that I am reviewing the meatball sub, however I ordered the chicken parmesan sub which it clearly read on my receipt.

Now for the best part, the sandwich! It had lots of thick-sliced bacon strips in it, avocado slices, tomato, lettuce, and just the right amount of chipotle mayo. I liked that they didn't slather the mayo on, so it wasn't oozing out the sides of the sandwich when I bit down.

The food is affordable ($2.50/taco) and delicious.  I had the beef Barbacoa and calabacitas tacos both of which are not on the normal menu.  Both tacos were delicious!  The barbacoa was tender and juicy and the calabacitas (squash with cheese) were on point.  I liked the red salsa the best which was spicy and flavorful.  The green salsa was also good.

qxP37vVGk14e-0Fz5-nXsg,rbMCv9k9ikBfQ-GDdSniQA,Er2XAYN8l1BadlYFwiPb9g,"Hello Followers:  Today I am writing about AZ Kabob House.  We have been to this restaurant twice, so my review summarizes both visits.  This is a small restaurant located in a strip mall, so don't look for it from the street or you will drive by.  Staff are friendly and are willing to answer questions you have.  But, be specific in your questions or you will receive a ""general"" answer.

First, this is not a sit down and be served restaurant.  This is a walk in, order at the counter, and your food it brought to you type of restaurant.  Which is fine - - - but if you are bringing a date it may not be what you expect.

Regarding the food:  We have ordered several dishes here.  Our favorite is the boneless chicken breast kabob.  

The chicken breast kabob ($10):  Both times the chicken came out very tender and not overcooked.  We usually order 1/2 rice and 1/2 salad.  The salad is a perfect compliment to the chicken spices.  The portion served is perfect for one hungry adult, or for an adult with a medium appetite and one child.  Since the dishes are made to order the ""hot"" things are served hot and items which should be ""cold"" such as the salad are cold - - but, they are all served on the same plate together.  This dish is served with a grilled tomato which was a nice touch.  I give the chicken dish a four-star stand alone rating.

The grilled salmon ($15):  The salmon had a nice flavor to it (not strong) and was not overcooked.  I ordered it well done and it came out well done, seared nicely from the grill and spices, but not overcooked.  Again, we ordered 1/2 rice and 1/2 salad on the side.  This dish was NOT served with a grilled tomato and we missed that!  In fairness to the restaurant, the menu did not say it was served with a grilled tomato, but we did not notice that until we were served.  I don't understand why it would not be.  It is served the same way as the chicken breast kabob and it is the only Fish Entree on the menu.  Because of this, I would give the salmon dish a three-star rating stand alone because it is not consistently served as the other kabob dishes are.
To order the salmon and pay $5.00 more than the chicken entree, the chicken is a better deal.

Note:  For those of you who only eat wild-caught salmon as opposed to farm-raised salmon, you would have to ask about the salmon before ordering. 

The pita bread served with your meal is nothing special.  Plain, nondescript.  it would have been wonderful with melted butter brushed on it and grilled.  Now, served like this - - - that would create a tasty platter!     

The Fesenjon:  is a stew made with ground walnuts with pomegranate sauce served with chicken or small meat balls.  We ordered it with the chicken, although, we could not find the chicken in the dish!  It was barely there or they forgot to add it to the dish is what I think happened here.  Unfortunately, we got this as a take out so we did not realize it was missing until the next day and we lived too far away to drive back.  
Issues:  The sauce was very, very sweet, thick and gritty.  I understand the pomegranates make the sauce sweet but this was so sweet it could have passed for a dessert.  There were not the correct mix of spices incorporated into the dish to offset the walnuts and the pomegranates.  Therefore, I would only give this dish by itself a two-star rating.     

There are what they call ""freshly made"" desserts at the check out counter.  But, I wonder if they really make a fresh pan of baklava every day??  I am Greek and know the work that goes into an authentic baklava.  

The movie theater is in the same complex, so if you want a casual afternoon or evening to see a movie, then grab a bite to eat here would make for a nice set of events to enjoy.",3,2016-06-06 0:37

We waited an hour to be seated, but I didn't mind. We sat at a table outside near a heater and drank some wine. We could have been seated earlier, but we wanted a private table instead of a seat at the communal table. 

I was a bit disappointed that they charged for bread and oil/vinegar for dipping. I think  this should be provided at every Italian restaurant for free, especially considering the prices and small portions for the rest of the food.

The server was very nice and gave great recommendations regarding the food. When the bill came, we told her that the bottle of wine was missing on the bill, and she didn't even say thanks for letting her know, which I thought was strange, since it was an extra $40. 

All in all, this place was ok, but I probably won't go back.",3,2012-02-15 18:51

Thursday was 50 cent wings. So I got six honey hot. It was nice and saucy and delicious! The skin is nice and crunchy and big pieces. My coworkers got the hot, they didn't come with sauce like I'm used to and all of them were served with blue cheese. Want ranch? You have to ask for it.

I got the Fish & Chips with house salad. Sorry about the picture, by the time I remember to take one I had already dug in! LoL Okay, the whole meal was huge and I pushed food on my coworkers and still had to waste some of it. The house salad is a big serving. A huge helping of shoe string fries that I piled on a plate and handed over to my coworkers, the few I had were tasty. The fish are bigger than my hand and I was given 2 pieces. It was good with the tarter sauce that wasn't JUST tarter sauce, it had some kind of orange tint to it. Hot sauce? But it was delicious and I could only eat one.

The fruity tea I got was delicious, freshly brewed - ask for extra ice.

My coworker got the soup of the day, cream of potato bacon. It had huge chunks and my coworker said it was delicious. Two coworkers got the BLT half sandwhich and it came with heaping pile of bacon that looked extra crispy and something I would get next time.

If there was one restaurant I'd recommend in the entire Phoenix metro for a great meal/experience this would be at the top of the list.  Cafe Monarch is great and sure has found a niche that it thrives well in.  Very out of the ordinary with the owner holding the duties of chef/hostess/busser/and server, but he sure does it well.
 
Having a very limited menu posted near the front door proudly tells what the chef wants to serve his patrons for that day. There's only two to three items listed with little description.  I was a little confused myself as I like to understand and take control of things, but I soon realized this was something to let the creator(the chef) to have his way with.  
 
His creations come with enormous skill glorifying fresh ingredients into a dish that can appeal to anyone's palette.  I've enjoyed salads with salmon and chicken the times I have visited, but who knows what will be on the menu on my next visit.  Whatever it is, I will must certainly try it!

Humble Pie offers a variety of unique pizza options. Most recently I tried the ""shrimp"" (topped with house-made mozzarella, shrimp, herbs and lemon zest). It was an interesting combination of ingredients and tasty! Our table also decided to share the apple and arugula salad (jicama, tomatoes and greens with a lemony vinaigrette). The larger portion was the perfect size for 3. The name implies there should be apples in it. I was confused because there wasn't a single slice.  

This place can get to be a little expensive when you order a couple pizzas and have a few drinks so dig for some coupons or check their website for ""deals"" on specific nights during the week. Happy hour might be a good option too. It runs from 11am to 6 pm. Most wines by the glass, specialty drinks and draft beers are $5. The best deal I found was right from their website.

Jerk fried rice is consistent and, as always, yummy (especially with a little extra Emerald sauce mixed in!). The rock stars of the party are those mouthwatering black beans! I could stuff myself to the brim on those puppies.

The setup is a bit like Five Guys or Fuddruckers - you walk up to the counter and order your burger and side. You have a choice of bun (white, wheat, onion) and cheese (American, swiss, cheddar, provolone). They call your name and you add your own condiments from the condiment buffet (which doubles as the salad bar). I really like this setup because you get to put as little or as much whatever you want on it. I wish they had some hot cheese like Fuddruckers, though. My burger with fries was $5.99 - they charge extra for cheese and extras like mushrooms or bacon. A soda with unlimited refills (and they have one of those crazy touch screen soda machines) was $1.79.

It's a cute little place with a nice assortment of salads, sandwiches, wraps, and soup. It all sounded pretty good, so I decided to split the difference with their half-and-half special with half a salami and goat cheese sandwich and a curry chicken salad. My wife got the thai salad and their tortilla soup. 

I would have to say the salami sandwich was the best of the choices. It was an interesting taste combination, and they had some other ones listed (asparagus panini?) that sounded both unusual and rather tasty. I always like to see places play with flavors and try something new.

Everything else was just... okay. Not bad, just not great. The place was kind of cramped at the peak of the lunch rush, and people had to scoot in and out on their chairs to let people get to tables.

We went with burgers for dinner and I have to say my nearly perfect burger was the most delicious burger I ever had out and is deserving of a more fitting name like maybe Mary Poppins, Practically Perfect in Every way! I tried what they named the sweet chili Burger. This burger doesn't need cheese or bacon or even sauce to make it taste good. This burger was really different and creative with layers of flavors and the perfect bun to meat ratio. The roll was buttery fresh and lightly salted and never fell apart while eating the sandwich. The delicious patty is made of Short rib , sirloin , chuck and brisket and is also seasoned. Toppings were pickled fresno chiles ,onions , cucumbers and under the patty were greens. This combination was a flavor bomb! My only minor criticism is the patty seemed a bit dense and maybe the meat was packed too tight. The side I picked were the mixed vegetables and they were beautiful above average vegetables including broccolini and wax beans. I really enjoyed this burger.

My husband enjoyed the Kelly's Original Burger and had the tasty perfect onion straws with it.

Each of them had a very slightly different taste (the Masala had a nice light sweetness and the Saag had a real taste of spinach), but we really liked them.  

We prefer food that is flavorful rather than just fiery hot, and Marigold Maison's mild version was perfect.  You could taste the flavors while still getting some kick to keep it interesting.

I agree with some of the other commentators that the prices seem slightly higher than some others, particularly given the non-fancy ambiance, but the portions are very generous.  We had plenty to take home and enjoy the next day.

Also, the staff was friendly and attentive (although we were there on a night that wasn't very busy due to the rain - yes it rains in Phoenix).  We liked it enough to buy a gift certificate, so we will be going back.",5,2016-01-08 20:07

I guess being leered at all day by half-drunk frat boys really grinds on you, so maybe that explains the extraordinarily bad service.

Our hostess forgot to tell the waitress we were seated, so that took forever to even get drinks. Then, she forgot to bring our appetizers. All that would've been fine -- some people just have bad days -- but the food was somehow beneath actual street tacos and more bland than Chili's.

QYaOh6pFO_kl4G4uMGbs4w,0mNfkamYuPTbgq91El0Zcw,F73T-N5lRNL2Gcpg0Q4KKw,"Let me start off saying the decor of this place is very beautiful and modern. I was really excited to try this restaurant. The menu is very long and the waiter explained that most of the dishes were small plates. We wanted to try a good variety. I felt like everything needed to be explained and it was exhausting. Everyone around us were saying they were friends of the chef so they got a ""special"" menu.

We started with.. 
-Calabrian Cauilfower- This was okay, had tons of olive oil on it.
-Bellwether Farms Ricotta-The ricotta tasted extra sweet on the bread.

Next we wanted to try a few different pastas. I am a big fan of fresh made pastas. 
-Agnolotti- This one was various ground up types of salami type meats, with a chicken broth poured on top. It was okay, very small.
-Strozzapreti- This is one of the only pastas they don't make in house. It was okay. It was a very simple dish. 
-Casoncelli-This dish looks beautiful but is extremely sweet. Its like eating a pie. I'm glad it was small because anymore would be too much. 

I hate to say it but the pasta didn't change my life. I am willing to pay for fresh pastas but this just didn't do it for me. 

The bread and butter on the plate was pretty and simple. It had good flavor.

I had the 7oz Creekstone Filetto. This was the best part of the whole meal, the filet was cooked nicely. The cheese potatoes were like a little too rich, but good. 

This would be a good place to get a glass of wine and dress up, but not much more. I feel like a lot of the dishes were overrated and underwhelming. The menu will be expensive to pay for the rent at Scottsdale and Lincoln. Nothing I ate makes me want to come back. Loved the decor. That is all.",3,2016-11-28 21:30

Smoked olives appetizer was yummy, so that abated my hunger a bit during the long wait. I ordered the veg crepe, boyfriend ordered the breakfast burro. The breakfast burro was too heavy for my tastes, but I enjoyed my veg crepe a lot. It's basically like a samosa in a crepe, with a little fried/baked cheese on top.

I try and live Gluten-Free and have yet to ask them if they can come up with a crust for GF pizza, but weirdly enough I don't feel bad after eating it and didn't gain any weight.

kx-vybEvIuEIO_5HEMJk_w,bAdsFiJbGiRzBzhSTUD_2A,#NAME?,"Went to Half Moon for lunch recently.  Not our first visit, and more than likely not our last.  We arrived during lunchtime, and the place was basically dead.   The server was patient with us, as some of the other people in my party kept needing some time to review the menu.  Once we ordered, it did seem like it took a little longer than normal to get the food out.  

I ordered the basic burger with cheddar and avocado on a whole wheat bun.  First, the menu lists premium toppings for burgers, such as avocado, bacon, grilled onions, etc.  This listing states I would receive a generous helping of my premium topping.  I definitely do not agree that the avocado was plentiful (in fact, it was probably 50% of the amount I received on an Earl's hamburger just a week prior).  Second, the whole wheat bun seemed kind of dry.  It was not toasted or warmed, which seemed unusually as well.  The fries that came with the burger, however, were quite good.  I scarfed them all down, along with a couple from one of my lunch companions...  

Because the burger was only average and the food took a little while to come out, I'm giving Half Moon three stars.  I'm sure that I'll be back, and highly recommend this place for their 3-7 pm happy hour when apps are 50% off (though I do wish they would bring back the sloppy joe nachos...)",3,2009-03-31 21:55

For $5 each, we got lobster pot stickers (3), Beef Skewers (3 single bites) with Kimchee Cucumber Salad. I had the 1988 with Grapefruit juice, pomegranate and lychee...YUM. My husband had a Mai Tai and wasn't overly thrilled with it. It was all yellow and not overly tasty (just pineappley). We each ordered a glass of wine to take with us for dinner ($5 vs. $15 on the dinner menu...getting it there was much more cost-effective). 

The staff was very friendly. They surprisingly got very busy all at once, so there were some delays in service but we were in no rush so didn't mind. The seafood was very tasty. Portions are on the small side though. One item in my seafood sampler was not as it should have been (stuffed shrimp arrived empty!). The waiter asked the chef about it and tried to convince me it was really there but just on the outside which was irritating because it clearly wasn't. So, the chef gave me a blob of stuffing on the side. A little odd, but at least some effort was made to make it right. 

The Chocolate souffle is certainly worth the $10.50 and 20 minute prep time. THE BEST. 

If you want a little tropical getaway, it's a great place to go. Expect it to be a bit pricey (if not doing Aloha Hour) and portion sizes a little small, but the tastes are very large and worth it and they do make special occasions special!",4,2010-06-08 15:42

My wife and I absolutely love Gadzooks.  The options are wide, and everything I have gotten has been delicious.  Basically, you start by choosing tacos or enchiladas (or soup, but let's be real, you came for the enchiladas).  Then, you choose a protein (I recommend the chicken, super tender and not dry).  You add cheese, sauce, and it your enchiladas get thrown into an oven to melt together into ooey-gooey goodness.

After THE MELTING (which is totally what they should call it) you get to choose some salsas and extras that are all pretty delicious.  Especially their cabbage slaw.  

My one and only gripe with this place is that their cornbread, while it is the single best thing I've ever eaten (okay, maybe hyperbole but it's so good), SHOULD NOT BE A MAIN PROTEIN.  It should be a topping, and I would top it on everything imaginable.  But I've never met anyone who said, ""Hm, I think I want a cornbread enchilada or taco today.""  So then you're left getting bread inside of bread for lunch, and let's be real, that's a recipe for disaster. 

 Of note, when I found this place at the taco festival in Scottsdale last year, they had a Cornbread Chicken Taco which was the whole reason I went to Gadzooks in the first place, but when I ask for both chicken and cornbread on my enchilada in the actual store I get this  death stare from the employees like I just asked them to commit some tragic offense.

Either way, this place is amazing.",5,2018-07-12 0:15

We usually go on a Friday night when you would think there would be a lot of people there.  My boyfriend's favorite menu item is the gastro pub burger - he is completely addicted.  We used to try different restaurants along Mill, but since he tried that burger we go nowhere else.  I personally like to mix it up a little.  I have tried the bratwurst sliders, the asian chicken bites, and the sausage platter and all were very good.  Their beer selection used to be very German (boring) but they have really upped their game and offer a wide variety of beers now.  My boyfriend and I really enjoy what we get every time we go.

We got the little dirty (half dozen, pick yourself) and we got 2 fruity charms donuts. We also got a maple long john on the side as they don't count toward the half dozens. The three donuts, of the seven we got, were extremely stale and unpleasant. Absolute hockey pucks. Two bites, trashed. It was extremely disappointing and so based on this, I can say this place is a hit or miss on freshness.

For the price of the donuts ($11 per 6), it was at best a two star experience. Service is always nice but all in all, we will not be driving up here anymore for donuts. The freshness is mediocre, at best.",2,2018-06-12 18:53

iV-_JdT9iA09ATKsY19_Ig,wku4DoyLzZBnPV-ZOKwojg,Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw,"A little kindness goes a long way, boys.  This review is for the 3 star lunch buffet and the 1 star service.  I have to admit that I am out and out soured for most Indian buffets in that my fave one in DC, Ragaa, makes me weep how good it is.  But one of my fellow Yelp buddies said this place made her belly happy, so I gave it a try. The smells and sight of the sparkling dining room made me thing that good things were coming my way.  As I perused the buffet, I noticed that it was really geared towards quantity rather than quality.  Tandoori chicken was way overcooked (and all dark meat - not a big deal, but it seems like they are saving the white meat for something else - maybe dinner?) and the other meat dishes were just so-so.  Saag paneer was tasty, as was the daal, but both forgettable.  And the rice!  It wasn't fluffy and light like you'd expect, but a little crunchy - a sin at an Indian restaurant as far as I'm concerned!  The only true delight is the warm, hot naan that they bring by to sop up the sauce on your plate.  I could make a meal of just it, except that $10 is a little steep.

My true issue with the place is the sheer lack of kindness on the face of anyone that works there.  It's like they are pissed off that they have to serve you and want to be elsewhere.  Fine by me!  Go away and have someone else serve me that'll say ""You're welcome!"" when I say ""Thank you"" instead of scowling and walking away.  We actually got into an argument the first time I went there - we were a party of three, but a friend was coming so I asked for a table for four.  The friend never came, so we were surprised when they charged us for four buffets and then put up a fight when we asked to take the fourth charge off for a person that was never there.  Come on, man!  You served us bread and water our entire meal - you saw only the three of us.  Sad.

I have to admit, I do return to this place when friends suggest it for lunch - like a drunken hookup, I fall into it and then ask myself what I am doing once I am there.  I need to scope the valley for a new place and stop giving in to convenience of location.",2,2012-08-28 1:07

I bookmarked this place a while ago but the timing never worked.  Opportunity finally came last Friday when I had a flight coming home with arrival time 10:15am. 7 mins drive from the airport, it was the perfect opportunity for me to finally try here.

As all other reviewers said, the line is long.  My business partner arrived there around 20 mins before 11:00am and he already saw 30 people waiting in front of him.  When i got there 5 mins before 11:00am, there was no more parking.  I just sat there until someone leave.  Parking attendant is very nice, he gave me a bottle of water and helped me park in a very tight spot.

Yes the wait is long, but they do what they can to help you wait (bottle of waters, sun screen lotion, chairs, tents (shade)).....

This time I tried their newest one at Kierland Commons and the setting was just perfect. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour so we opted to sit at the bar which was a lot of fun. We ordered the bruschetta board with a bottle of rose from Spain since it was their Tuesday night special for $20! 

Each bruschetta is seriously better than the next. I have listed all the flavors in  my picture and I can't even pick a favorite, because they're all so good. For the amount of food and alcohol, the price is incredible! The service is also top notch and super friendly.

Y0FiJcuQAtfxcOuoyQ908A,ItazujysWfGqEGxntilYIw,PgpO8RswM-xOitG4PBNo1w,"Ok, I finally hit up Hurts Donut this morning because I was in the area. The line was a bit slow and I managed to *not* throttle the uber pro Betsy Devos woman in the line who was annoying the crap out of the elderly couple in front of me who disagreed with her all while she was acting like she was god's gift to sunshine. That's not anything to do with donuts though.

So you get your dozen and half dozen one of two ways. You let them pick or you pick. Letting them pick is a significant difference in cost. $3 difference in both cases. While I can see how this can save them money on time and making sure donuts get bought it functions like a tax for those of us who have dietary restrictions and can't eat any old option they choose. A number of their donuts have bacon which I can't eat, was likely in the they picked mix, and kept getting pushed on me by the staff. So that annoyed me. Either way they cost more than my other favorite local donut place.

Also, when I went to order it turns out only round donuts can be included in your dozen. All others cost extra. Fritters, kolaches, everything. Even just normal long johns. I thought that was a bit obnoxious.

The boxes also kind of annoyed me. I'm really feeling I've been spoiled by my other local donut chains that all have donut boxes where all the donuts lay flat next to each other. Instead their boxes have them all standing up and smooshing into each other. Getting frosting and stuff all over the other donuts. Considering they are supposed to be this super cool donut place with ultra fancy donuts you would think they would want them to all lay down side by side friendly and showing off their individual uniqueness. I guess not. They even on their own chose to put one of my donuts in a separate bag to avoid getting the others gooey. Seriously guys, get a flat donut box.

Last of my issues was so very many of the flavors were cake donuts. I hate cake donuts. That's entirely on me though and not a fault of Hurt's.

Now, with me being cranky about all that I did finally try three of the donuts I bought. PB&J, Nutella, and Captain Crunch Cereal Killer. Holy Shit. These donuts are fucking amazing. My mouth is so very very happy. I still have a salted caramel chocolate, an apple pie, and a plain glazed in my box and I'm so ready to eat them.

There was a word that we used for poachers that did the same thing while hunting deer, when I was a kid back in Oregon...""Asshole"".

He did prove to me that I will need to move any and all business I can away from GoDaddy...""vote with your feet""...but I guess that's another review.

The Beautiful Carin and I were in Scottsdale on business this past week and we take these opportunities to spend time with those near and dear to us!

At the very tippy top of the ""near and dear"" list is our lovely daughter, Whitney.

Whit is a Vegan...with a capital ""Vege""...and she was distraught by the wanton slaughter of an African elephant by some dot bomb misogynist.

So she was thrilled that her meat lovin' daddy was going to take her to Green for dinner...an experience so very alien to me that I made Carin pick up a pound of fully cooked bacon and bring it to dinner in her purse for me...just in case!

I am not a Vegan...I was born and raised on a cattle ranch...I do love a good medium rare rib-eye...I don't think it hurts Elsie the Cow to have a teat twiddled so I can have cream in  my coffee or cheese on my burger...and yet, the elephant deal brought a tear to my daughters eye and touched my black flinty excuse for a heart!

I checked Yelp and saw that while my Vegan friends on yelp love this place, my decidedly carnivorous Yelpy friends were also nearly unanimous in their agreement that Green is foodgasm inducing!

We ordered way too much food...Chili Fries, Egg Rolls, a Green Burger, the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, No Harm Chicken Parm...I barely had room to choke down a couple of Tsoynami's and an oatmeal cookie sandwich!

Even after we were stuffed, Whitney took home enough leftovers for a week!

The big question about Green is ""why didn't I ever eat here, when I lived here...Why?""

I don't know...but I will be putting on my hemp cargo shorts, a tie dye t-shirt and growing a neck beard...and I will be eating here again.

I like to ""fit in"".

The menu is fairly extensive...the portions are plenty big...the flavors are bright and well defined and the textures and aroma's (always a big deal for me) are both exotic and welcoming.

I didn't have to break out the bacon (although I should have taken my flask...no cocktails at Green for Donald...oh well, agave sugar cola was a delightful departure from the ordinary).

I really could eat this way on a regular basis...it's that good...I probably won't, but it's nice to know I could!

I imagine that Karma will have it's own way of dealing with a self-justifying, trigger happy technotard...for me, the occasional dinner at Green nicely balances the Karmic forces at work in my life...and tastes good, too!",4,2011-04-02 3:39

We were there for happy hour and sat up at the bar. The bartender was completely cool.

We've seen this place for years but never stopped before. We were in the neighborhood this time and decided to give it a try.
I do not know what is that I was expecting, but this was not it.
It was good, though.
It is kind of tiny, it is more of a bar...
And, oh my, they had something like incense burning or some odd smell... not for me : (
We sat by a corner and Mike was our server.
He was outstanding. He asked if we had been there before and gave us some history and recommendations. He was very friendly and approachable.

Well, we like it when a place has a signature dish, and for Armadillo Grill it seems to be fried pickles. Not my proudest moment, truth be told, but they were actually good : P
We had half regular, half Cajun. I liked them both but I liked the ranch best.

We ended up ordering the Thai Chicken skewers and the Louisiana meatball sandwich.
I just tasted them both as I was not very hungry, I thought they were a good and hubby liked them very much. He said the chicken skewers were very tasty even without the sauce.

We call a couple popular standbys but there is no way a 45 minute wait will do. We call Scramble and are told it is a ten minute wait. We're just a couple blocks away so we're in the parking lot in about five minutes. Considering the line is out the door, down the sidewalk, and into the parking lot, I'm having second thoughts as we stop at the end of a long queue with a lot of people mumbling (more than a few conversations about how many open tables were inside). An insincerely chipper employee at the door calls for the line to form further down the sidewalk ""so no one gets run over by a car in the parking lot.""

I figure the line must move quickly but, after seeing the line is growing I can only assume that, at best, the wait is ten minutes after you finally get the counter to order. We scope out the situation for a few minutes as the line continues to grow and our position moves forward only about four feet. Clearly ten minutes was a lie. I call another place, find out they have no wait, and we start walking back to our car. As we approach the vehicle, an unprompted farewell is called to us, ""Take care! Have a good morning!""

I usually get smoothies like this around the corner from China Magic Noodle House, but I decided I would go for a change and get something different, so I finally tried this place after reading all the reviews. I was originally going to get a milk tea when I got there, but I decided to get the watermelon slush so I can compare it to CMNH. When I tasted it, I was disappointed. It was very obviously that fake watermelon syrup flavoring and did not have any trace of real watermelon. It was seriously just sugar in a cup with a splash of watermelon flavoring. To make things worse, I also ordered calamari, for charged for it, and then had (I'm assuming) the manager come by and tell the cashier that they're not offering it right now.

The taste is great, but somehow you cannot replicate the original. The skin on the dumplings was too thick and the soup dumplings didn't hold up super well but still really good.

Tofu and seafood soup was very light and excellent with generous portions of tofu. They were kind enough to remake a dish we ordered of which we considered too salty.

Just one suggestion that I think would enhance the business: Maybe take orders outside (similar to Portillo) on a tablet that can assist with expediting... however this wouldn't work if you end up running out of food which often happens at this location so that could be why they haven't implemented this idea.

It was after 8 PM on a Sunday and I was literally craving a Greek salad but for the life of me, couldn't remember who would be open at this hour. And then...DING DING! Duh, Pita Jungle is right by my house and open later than most quick places. 

I am absolutely in love with their Mediterranean Chicken Salad. I could drink the lemon dressing. It is so light and refreshing. The salad is packed with their delicious marinated chicken, golden raisins, taboule, corn, feta, onions, roasted bell peppers, cucumbers, toasted pine nuts, and cilantro. 

If i'm feeling VERY hungry, i'll get a small order of Baba Ganoosh with a pita! This is a delicious dip consisting of broiled eggplant, tahini, greek yogurt, garlic, evoo, lemon juice, and a ratatouille garnish. It is different than hummus and SO dang good! 

I will say, for the salad and a small baba to go, it is usually around $18 but hey, it is fresh, healthy, and WORTH IT! 

Their Happy Hour is also definitely worth mentioning. They have a variety of tapas ranging from $1-$3 and house wine is only $3 is well! Can you say, YES PLEASE?! It is Monday - Friday from 3-5:30 PM and reverse is daily from 9 PM - close.

Last night, my roommate and I dined at The Arrogant Butcher before our concert at Comerica.  Our reservations were for 6:30.  We were quickly seated.  I ordered the Polish Fix drink, which was delish!  We put in an order of the pretzels and provolone fondue around 6:45.  It arrived at our table at 7:25.  The restaurant was busy, but does it really take that long to bake pretzel bites and melt some cheese?  If this review was based solely on the appetizer, I would give it 5 stars.  What a fun and very tasty pre-dinner treat!!  By far, best part of the meal.  We had put in our order not too long after our appetizer order was placed.  By the high recommendation of our waiter, my roommate ordered the jumbalaya and I chose the market soup (Tomato Bisque) and the Chopped Salad.  Our entrees came out around 7:40.  My soup/salad was pretty good.  I was pleased.  My roommate was less than thrilled with her choice.  I asked her to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being amazing and 1 being awful.  She gave the jumbalaya a 2.5.  Needless to say, we skipped dessert and signed our check an hour and a half after being seated.  Good thing neither of us were interested in the opening act for the concert or we would've missed it.  This is not the first Fox restaurant where service has been incredibly slow and food so-so.  Would go back for drinks or with a date who was footing the bill.  Not worth the price, in my opinion.",2,2011-06-16 17:23

ON2WT12YCiZdtEym9_fZOQ,Va4F93yyOoL60oeIXBzVMw,uKKNw68mZZaa1jcyszEbyA,"Brunch on a Tuesday???? Yup!!! We were around the Tempe area for an early appointment so we decided to have brunch around Tempe as well. We decided to have crêpes. If you want crêpes, you go to a place that specializes on Crêpes, right? If a place is called Crêpe Bar, I guess that means they do good crêpes.

We found the place off of S Rural. The place is small but can probably sit 50 people. The vibe of the place was upbeat. Music played in the background but it wasn't very loud. Just kept the place cozy and vibrant. The colors on the walls were appealing. Hues of blue and grey fill the place with accents of green, orange and pastel colors.

Let's talk about their food. It was AWESOME!!!! My first five star on Yelp. From the service, to the place and ofcourse the food... IT WAS AWESOME (it was so awesome I wrote it three times already). We had The Burro (savory), The Grand Prix (savory) and the Vanilla Bean Custard (sweet) crêpe. We also had the Maya tea and the Hot caramel latte for our drinks.

The Burro... this is your breakfast burrito on a crêpe. Crêpe was chipotle flavored with scrambled eggs, chorizo, avocado and pepper jack cheese. I would have wanted a little more of the sauce used for plating. I feel that it really complimented the dish. The little sauce on my plate did not make the experience less enjoyable though. There was a surprising kick on every bite with a hint of sweetness from the crêpe and savory delight from the chorizo. The avocado definitely completed that southwest flavor and added a refreshing flavor to the dish.

The Grand Prix was my favorite. I love the creamyness of the fat from the pork belly that was cooked to perfection. It melts in your mouth. There was also the added crunch from the maple glazed pork jowl. The pork glory is placed on a bed of coffee Crêpe topped with a sunny side up egg. I would have loved it more if the egg was little runny but overall I would order it again and recommend it to everyone. 

We ended our meal with the vanilla bean custard with strawberries, almonds and salted caramel. It wasn't too sweet considering the salted caramel and vanilla custard. The perfect bite would be a piece of crepe, a bite of strawberry, a dash of candied almonds, topped with custard and salted caramel. Everything just goes well together.

We would definitely come back. Maybe we'll bring friends with us next time to share our new found favorite Crêpe bar in Arizona.

Certified yum for the buck!

There was a large selection of food from oysters on the half shell to artisan cheeses to fish and chips to steak to popcorn shrimp.  With such lack of culinary focus one might think mediocrity would come with every dish, but I happily report not.  We had oysters, skirt steak, bread and roasted vegetables, and some small assorted plates.  Everything was fantastic.

The combination of urban patio, eclectic menu, and great service make for a fun meal.  The one complaint I have is the price.  It's quality food but I did feel a little taken.  For instance, a draft beer was nearly $6 (I see it as an index since beer, even when hand crafted, is like the cheapest stuff on earth).  Anyway, it loses one star for the gouge but people with deeper pockets and looser fingers may add the star back.",4,2011-04-06 9:50

I am afraid my review is going to sound a bit repetitious of previous yelps, but I figured I should add my two cents. 

I love Oreganos. When I was attending college in Tucson, Oreganos was just opening up. In fact my roommate and I attended a group interview in an attempt to snag a job, but unfortunately they did not find our request to wear diner outfits and call ourselves Dot and Myrtle amusing. Perhaps we were just too excited to serve pizza. 

I enjoy the pizza (I am not above thin crust), pasta, and atmosphere- in fact it is my in laws favorite place to go when they are in town. The pesto pasta with chicken added is my go to on the menu. The chicken is thin, almost shaved, strips and they absorb all the yummy pesto goodness. The one thing that keeps me from making the drive to Oreganos more often is the wait. No reservations, first come first served type of place and despite them having plenty of seating options, and on occasions open tables, I never seem to get out of there with less than a 30-45 minute wait. Regardless of the time of day, day of week, season, etc. there is always a wait. Once you get past the wait for the table, then you wait a little more for your server, then your food and when it is all said and done my dinner has stretched out to 1 1/2 -3 hours (depending on how many of us) and sometimes there is not enough goodness on a plate that can make up for that amount of time for pizza. 

While some people complain that it is a chain, it is a local start chain, which keeps it out of the axis of evil for me. I will continue to return to Oreganos on occasion, when I have absolutely no plans to follow my meal.",3,2009-01-11 22:49

For me, this is a special occasion restaurant. You can't be faint of wallet when going here.  The prices are high, but here you get what you pay for.  They are also extremely accommodating. My wife and I split meals, with me getting about 2/3 of it. That was fine with them and we enjoyed the four course dinner between the two of us.

I've read the 24 reviews that came before mine over and over, and I have to say, it was even better than expected!

Picture this:
Sunday evening - dark and cold outside.  Hanging inside with fiance and future sister-in-law.  All of us feeling tired and hungry but too lazy to cook dinner.  Just watched Grey's Anatomy and Private Practice reruns and worked up appetite...

Thai food?  I suggested to them - oh yeah, we can't do that... none of the thai restaurants are open on Sundays.  Damn.

Vietnamese maybe?  Nope - the closest one I could think of was closed on Sundays also.

Chinese?  Too bad we don't have a great Chinese restaurant close by in the new 'hood anymore.

I know, let's try somewhere new... Totties!  I called to make sure they were open, and sure enough - not only were they open, but they are not even a mile away!  Perfect...

Tottie's was awesome - it was nicer inside than I imagined - for some reason I had in my head that it was going to be like Pei Wei - but it wasn't at all.  We were seated immediately and Kethy was our server (yes, Kethy - not Kathy).  She was cute and had personality - something you don't always find in restaurants now-a-day.  She honored our request to start with a big bowl of egg drop soup and add wontons to it!

With the soup on the way, we perused the menu... I love that Tottie's offers Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and sushi too!  We mixed it up a bit and ordered Pad Se Ew with Beef, Moo Shu Chicken, Thai Basil Stir Fry veggies, and steamed vegetable dumplings.  Medium spice and light on the oil.  It was way too much food, but it was fun to share a bunch of dishes, and now we have leftovers for dinner tonight!

**Pad Se Ew was the favorite dish of all but nothing we ordered was disappointing.

Total bill for all of the above was $43 before tip... not bad considering the amount of food we had!  Service was attentive - not only from Kethy, but Tottie (I think) came by, and our waters were fill constantly too.

I will totally return to Tottie's in the near future whether it be for Chinese, Thai, Sushi, or Vietnamese - or a combo... oh, and I'll have to remember to save room for the avocado ice cream next time!",4,2009-01-12 23:07

We sat at the bar where there was only one bar tender - apparently the other left sick - and for the most part the service was very accommodating. I got an omlette that was massive, and they give you the choice between toast or pancakes. The sourdough toast I ordered was paired with fresh whipped butter and an individual sized jar of jam. If you order pancakes as your side, be prepared for a full, two-cake plate with whipped cream.

  The wait was not bad at all at first - maybe 15, 20 minutes. The more we have visited, the worse the wait times have become. Expect to wait 40 minutes for your food to arrive, and then watch the waiters ask every table on the way if the order is theres or not. The staff is so poorly trained and managed that its almost comical. The only other downside is a question of the general cleanliness of the restaurant and an odd restroom set up.

The reason, so many tempting items, I usually just t need to decide between the fish or veggie dish, but here every dish is a veggie dish.

We started our meal with fake crab puffs and samosas.  The crab puffs were great, crispy garlicky and for having no cheese egg or crab lacked nothing. The plate of puffs came with a thimble of sweet dipping sauce, and there were 5 puffs for $3.
 The plate of 3 samaos for $4 were not as impressive, there was too much cumin giving it a cinnamon taste, the warper was crisp and not greasy.

For my meal I went with the Thai peanut mock beef with brown rice. $7.50 I was happy to have brown rice as a standard option. The bowl while small had fresh crisp veggies, the sauce was a bit weak but the mock beef was interesting in flavor and texture.

It is order at the counter and they bring it to you style, they have a stage   so it may not be a great for a intimate chat. there is some couch and patio seating.

To start off my experience, I called ahead to see if I could make a reservation for 10 (a bunch of nurses who want to meet up after work, around 8pm when then dinner crowd would be dying down, I would think). I was on hold for 15 minutes while the hostess ""checked with her manager to see if the reservation was possible."" After 15 minutes of being on hold, I hung up and called back. She apologized that nobody ever picked up the phone and that their paging system is faulty. She then told me that the reservation at time I was requesting would not be possible because they were too busy. I told her to put us down for the earliest time possible which was about 30-45 minutes from my requested time, which we could work with, she also said the bar was first come first serve, so I figured we could grab a beer and appetizers in the bar while we wait for a table to open up. 

When we arrived, I check In for our reservation and told them we would be in the bar waiting. it was pretty busy in the dining room but we were able to find some scattered spots at the bar and high tops. Our server in the bar seemed overwhelmed and had a bit of an attitude. Another part of our group at the bar also said the bartender had a bad attitude as well. 

We had a round of drinks, paid for them, and then our table was ready. The other half of our group had ordered a pizza at the bar, not knowing when our table would be ready and asked if they could take it to our table in the dining room. They receive attitude from the bartender and ended up just eating it in the bar to reduce any problems this was supposedly causing. They could have paid for it and tipped the bartender, I don't really see what the big deal was. The staff had major attitude and we were just trying to wind down after long hard day working with really sick patients.

Ge6lm--L3WytNLwEgwQNFw,BlSbxxb1vyfFoLGjfHh5dg,5ykOWYZ44sUvu9qxD8rPeg,"Fail.

Walked in on a weeknight around 7 p.m. Tiny seating area all but full. One 4 top remaining. We asked to be seated there. A worker said that he'd rather we sit at the bar. Well, um, you have an open table and 2 people who want to sit and spend money here. No, I don't ""do"" bar seating to eat dinner. I'll sit at a bar if I want to knock back a drink or two, maybe have an app. and then take off. Sitting at a bar is not a comfortable way to relax over dinner and unwind after a long day.

So, no thank you. Despite awesome reviews that suggest the food is good. Attitude is important, too. There are ways to handle this kind of thing. And, there are ways to not handle this kind of thing. 

Probably will not make another attempt to try this place. I don't need attitude at the end of my long day.

NOTE: To the person who decided to call me out - by name - over this review, this was my legit reaction to my experience. I'm glad you had a better experience. Clearly many reviewers find that this place offers amazing food. I wish I'd been treated well enough to have been able to discover this for myself. No need to call anyone out by name, sir. Our experiences are our experiences. The Yelp community can help one another by providing honest feedback.

Second update: I've been debating whether or not to write this for a while. First off, there wasn't just one, but two fellow Yelpers who chose to call me out by name for the above review. Not cool! Like it or not, it's a legit recap of my experience. And, I was able to get one of those people's reviews taken down. No idea why the other stays put. Whatever. Here's the reason for this update: five months after I posted this review, the owner reached out to me via private email. Props to him for that even if it came five months after the fact. However, in his explanation, which was, actually, not unreasonable, he decided to say that I had ""stormed out."" Well, sir, that isn't true. How is it that I made such a memorable impression if I was in and gone in under a minute and it was many months ago? You said to our request to sit at a 4-top and I quote, ""I'd rather you sit at the bar."" You didn't say something like, ""I'm sorry but that table is reserved and we'll have another table in a few minutes."" Had you said that, sir, we very likely would have stayed. Clearly your food is very good; I dine out a lot and I rely on Yelpers to give good advice. Congrats for the good reviews on your food quality. But, don't take an opportunity and turn it right back on me saying that I ""stormed out"" before you could explain. Just for future reference, because it is truly awesome you can fill your restaurant, and serious congrats for that, it's not your customer's fault that you are full up. A friendly, ""we'll have an open table in just a bit"" works. ""I'd rather you sit at the bar"" doesn't play well. Good luck.",1,2016-08-18 4:41
pHKer9-BDruGcs7Mr_4lIw,tgofCn2y7e8lAQ_8y5k34g,VbqtbvvtNOe-YKA61-fSNA,"The Armadillo Grill really surprised me. A dive bar in the midst of all the pretentious restaurants and shopping center around the Baltimore area. A resturant / bar with pool tables and a bunch of tv's with sports. I love dive bars, however, I also like when they grow with the times.

I couldn't imagine coming here to watch a game, because despite their large quantity of TV's they are all too small and cheap in quality. 

We came on a Monday night late because a friend of ours has been out of town for a month and we wanted to meet up the SECOND she got back. I had the wings, (I'm sure you are shocked). The size and cooking of the chicken was fantastic, however I'm not a big fan when bars use breaded wings instead of grilled. 

The ladies got chopped salads which actually looked phenomenal. I def got 'out ordered'. 

I probably will only be back if a buddy wants to meet here, but I certainly can't see myself coming up with the idea to meet here for drinks especially in the Biltmore area where there are just so many other better options. 

However, I will say that this place probably has that local, consistent customer base where the same people frequent it on the same night of the week. A total cheers atmosphere for sure. So if you are close and live in the area and are looking for ""your dive""...this'll work.",2,2013-07-23 17:15

By the time we got to ordering, the fatty brisket ran out, but we were able to order one of everything else. The highlight was their beef ribs which was juicy, fatty, and just so flavorful. Turkey was unpopular in our group, but even then it was still very good.

Something noteworthy is that the owner who was cutting our meat paid close attention to the quality of what he was serving us. When he opened up a foil pack of pork ribs and saw that it was subpar, he told his staff it was not cooked right and to remove it. The staff really try to make your experience a positive one, and that was very nice.

We found a groupon, but it was only good for dinner 5pm-10pm, but we decided to try the buffet as it looked great, and the other yelp reviews were positive.

Well we were glad we went in.  The servers were wonderful and made sure our glasses were full with water and drinks the entire time.  I only usually get water, but they were nice enough to tell us drinks were included, so I had a sprit which was nicely carbonated, which is important!  There is nothing worse than not being able to feel the carbonation in the stomach moving things around. :-)

The servers also made this a wonderful experience in the fact that they also had my plate remove every single time I went back for more food, which was a lot!

All the food was hot and fresh.  I would suggest going around 11:30am when there were not that many people, because by 12:30pm, it was packed!

The food is nicely labeled and they had a variety of chicken, lamb, goat, and lots of vegetable choices.  I am a stickler on the rice and they had it cooked just right.

I think the part I like best is that I did not have to continue to ask for things like naam bread, they just knew to bring it to me.  The impression I got was that they are about the customer experience and not just trying saving a time.  I also asked for plain naam bread and they brought it to me without charge.

The food was not that spicy, I would assume because a buffet, but I am sure they would bring you extra spices if asked.  I was happy the way it was.

We have $25 and will definitely be back!

I flew in on a 1000 flight so decided to swing on by as it's close to the airport. I arrived there at 1050 and stood in line for 1 1/2 hours! I asked the people who work there what the best thing to get was and they said the brisket. Also told me the brisket typically is all gone by 1230-1245. 

They'll give out small pocket-sized ice-cold water bottles to you while you wait in line for free! Good idea as you don't want people passing out in the heat waiting in line. By the time I got to the line, I was hungry. 

Ordered the brisket and there's a fatty and lean brisket. You can ask for a mix of both. Also got the pork ribs and a sausage and jalepeno grits. Yeah, it was a lot of food. It's all amazing. And I've had BBQ in Kansas City, St. Louis, everywhere in the South. The meat is so good, you don't need BBQ sauce-it all gets served dry which is the correct way to serve BBQ if your BBQ is good. I recommend you eat half of it without the BBQ sauce then try the other half with it because the BBQ sauce is really amazing! 

So at around 1300 the line whittles down to about a 30m wait but again, most likely the brisket is all gone. The brisket, quite possibly the best brisket I've ever had. It's that stupid amazingly good. I really was shocked. I just didn't think it's be some good. Next time, 1000 in line for sure.",5,2016-02-29 1:28

It's no lie that I have had this little restaurant tucked away in an old house bookmarked for quite some time now. I had read great reviews and kept meaning to stop by, but for some reason it always slipped my mind. On a recent Tuesday night I decided to drag my husband out of the house and finally try out this little restaurant off 7th Street. Upon our arrival, I noticed that parking was a little scarce, but no big deal, we parked down one of the side streets and walked along the sidewalk to the cute little house The Main Ingredient calls home. We were immediately impressed by the patio that's littered with tables and chairs in front of an old porch. Pretty adorable. We walked in the front door and a young guy immediately informed us that we could choose our own table...don't mind if I do! Being a Tuesday night and all, the place wasn't exactly crowded so we chose a cozy spot in the corner with a hightop table and a TV close by. There was a unique mix of hip-hop-ish music being played that was a refreshing change from most restaurant tunes. We both immediately liked the setup of the restaurant and were excited to try out the menu that had everyone raving.

Unfortunately, the positive experience pretty much ended there. A little while after seating ourselves, a well-dressed, funky server came to take our drink order. Her exact words upon greeting us: ""What would you like to drink?"". I thought that was kind of weird. No ""hello"" or ""how's it going"", just straight to the point without any friendliness. Luckily the guy who brought our waters and ran our food was a little more pleasant. Since this was our first time here, there were multiple menu items we wanted to try out. We started with the chips and salsa which were pretty tasty and by far the best part of our meal. I ordered a Peach Ale and my man went with a Coke. After enjoying our chips and salsa, we were served our main course (which came out pretty quickly so timing wasn't really an issue). Ever since LGO got rid of their green chile mac and cheese I have been seriously searching for a replacement. I was hoping this would be it, but I was horribly disappointed. I have to admit that the mac and cheese was part of my reason for choosing The Main Ingredient that night and it just didn't hit the spot. In fact, it wasn't really mac and cheese at all. The consistency was bready and weird and I sincerely missed the cheesy pasta that makes mac and cheese such an American classic. I get that they're trying to do something different with the dish, but for me it just didn't work. I ate a few bites and definitely didn't ask to take the rest home. No thanks. My husband's meal was slightly better, he ordered the veggie sandwich, but just wasn't anything to write home about. Overall, we were disappointed with the food. For comfort food, it wasn't very comforting...

So after trying out the food, I was convinced they were a three star restaurant. Not horrible, but definitely not a new favorite. But when you throw in the horrendous service we received, their rating has to lose an extra star. After our lack-luster greeting, the service only went downhill from there. My husband sat for 10+ minutes without anything to drink, our server never came to ask how we were enjoying our meal, and our plates sat stacked on our table for more than 15 minutes while we waited for our check. We even watched our server bring other tables their checks while we continued to wait for our own. She wasn't busy waiting on tables, so I guess she was in the back doing something else. Not cool.

So I'm sorry to say this, but I just don't think The Main Ingredient will be added to our list of favorite restaurants around town. With the bad service and the disappointing food, it just doesn't compare to so many other great spots. It's a shame too because the atmosphere and menu really had some great potential. :(",2,2012-08-23 18:21

The patty melt included this amazing garlic parmesan sauce, along with the crispiest bacon I have seen.

Pros: it is pretty large and hefty, and the pita holds together. Surprisingly not a sloppy sandwich. The veggie toppings seemed pretty fresh and were crispy. Pickles are an odd thing to add to a gyro, but it wasn't bad.

Cons: its not real or fresh gyro meat. It is that processed compressed crap; even worse, it looks like the pre-sliced frozen kind!  Totally not acceptable for a restaurant and at that price.
Also, the sandwich ended up having 1 flavor - SALT.  It just tasted crazy salty.

0tlfWKAhgOkFgxetfYWxtQ,obettcCSzjToe-k4XJivYg,f30-DOoIxvoV9btiDvKMTw,"Let's First start out by saying the service was great and the atmosphere and ambiance was really enjoyable for me. I loved the call-back to the hallmarks of R&B music. 

The drinks we had were fantastic. Their mixologist, bar tender, mage of crafts, wizard of libations, I would pay 3 times the wage that Joes is paying Him just to come to my home kitchen and serve me drinks. 

But I just feel like Joes is still a young (opened in April 2016) and there were little oversights that a more tenured restaurant would have most likely have observed. 

I ordered the Sweetbreads... and based on the three pieces that managed to make it on my plate, were really delicious. I just really feel like I got gypped out of sweetbreads. 

And I love Bones, I love bone marrow (i'm  just gunna call it what it is, right now, Skelton butter) I'm more than willing to pay for a good plate of Bone Marrow. Unfortunately, what I got was a plate of Bone without the Marrow. Seriously, it looked great, but, the minuscule spoon full that I got only left a full plate of bread. 

Surprisingly enough, the liver pate was great. Somebody definitely put a lot of love into it. It's surprising, because I don't like pate. It was very well-balanced with good seasoning. I think Joes is some of the best I've tried. 

Now the wings. Let me preface this by saying, I survived Daddy Dukes Wing King Competition, so when I tell you they're  good you know that I know what I'm talking about. 

Fuck me rotten, the wings were awesome. Holy hell. I would cover my wife in that sauce if I could get enough of it into the tub. 

So really, I wanted to ""love"" Joes, but I remain hopeful, I wanna see them grow, and watch them cultivate their passion. I think they've got a great vision but they need a little more finishing school.",3,2016-11-30 4:48

I'm a purist donut lover. And I legit love donuts. I don't order donuts with 100 toppings, cereal or whatever. I'm a basic donut eater with an occasional smear of chocolate. 

I ordered the old fashioned and my sister ordered a few more. The donut, on first bite, tasted like the county fair. It was a funnel cake, essentially. If you love funnel cakes and want your donuts to taste similarly, this is your jam. As for me, it was too over fried.

I've been here twice and thought the food was great both times! The bruschetta is a must and enjoyed the first four listed on the menu. I cant recall what they are but I'm always happy with them. The place is a bit noisy and pricey. To avoid the noise, I suggest sitting outside because it is well shades, and you can actually talk to and hear what your friends have to say. Also the inside is a bit crowded for me. 

My finance and I kinda stick out like a sore thumb as this place because it predominately caters to older middle-aged Caucasians, and we are quite the opposite demographic, but I wont hold this detail against them. 

The reason I remove a star is because the cost is a bit hefty. If you come here for wine during happy hour, its a great deal, but not so much for the food, hence my initial warning that this post will only be about the food.",4,2011-08-11 2:00
KVzI4cmwbi0IVJvboWbH5Q,O5y7KlfBdqV6Ih8yhjZLsg,vyDW7_CHhDUJshMqaSjj0g,"My husband and I stopped in here one night right before 11pm after a concert. We walked up to the door and saw the hours posted on the door saying they close at 11, so we turned around and started walking away when a waiter opens the door and tells us ""We're open!"" so we go inside.  I believe they're open until 2am on Saturday night.

We are vegan and this restaurant is not geared towards the vegan crowd; however, they do have a garden burger on their menu.  They were so kind to make vegetable fajitas for my husband.  There drinks were superb with the Cadillac margarita being one of the best my husband has had!

Tony was our server and he was amazing! We sure enjoyed talking with him.  He loves working there and was so enthusiastic about his job (his 2nd job for many years) and his family. 

The atmosphere here is 2 stars but you need to overlook that.  The patio is way nicer than the inside. 

Give this place a try and support a locally owned business in downtown Phoenix!",4,2015-08-12 1:26
2dT3Tkd28YPamCFYR2S_Xw,F78tJHr0qW6FsYBtWMmLpA,Xg5qEQiB-7L6kGJ5F4K3bQ,"Location & Aesthetics - Located in Tempe just adjacent to the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.  
Parking is limited.  I wouldn't advice parking on the street besides I don't even think you could as the road is busy with traffic.  Parking is limited as the lot is small and gets filled up quickly.  This is a popular joint and many people come from all over to eat here.  If the parking lot is filled, my suggestion would be to park in surrounding businesses parking lots but only on the weekend as I did.  When I did so, the businesses were closed and their lots were empty except some of the restaurants customers had also parked in the lots as well.  
When you arrive, there's a staff member who directs traffic in the parking lot and will let you know what's finished and what isn't.  That's right, you heard me correctly, if you don't get there early enough, their meats will finish which I hadn't known.  
More often than not, when you arrive you will encounter a line unless you ordered your food online and just came by to pick it up. 
Be forewarned, the line moves snail-pace slow as there's only 1 carving station so be prepared to spend some time in the line.  Thankfully there's chairs to sit if you're in line and there's free bottles of water.  I even saw a bottle of sunscreen though I wasn't sure if that was for everyone or if someone left it there by mistake.

Menu - Unfortunately there aren't any menus available to view but you can see what's available online.  Alternatively you can ask the gentleman who's directing traffic and he'll take you out of the line and let you go inside and take a pic of the menu with your phone as I saw someone did who was in front of me.  You can order your meats by the pound, by the plate, or by sandwich which is basically it.

Service - The staff was spectacularly nice, friendly, warm and welcoming.  There's 3 behind the counter - the carver who individually cuts the meat and weighs it for you, a guy who serves you the sides, and the cashier.  There's another guy who walked around with an apron that looked like the cook so I assumed he must've owned the place.
You can eat inside which is small or outside that has long picnic like tables.

Food - Now, despite the fact that the meats do run out because from what the guy who was walking said (the one with the apron), he only cooks 'x' amount of meat a day and don't reheat so when it runs out that's it, but I have to say it's really worth the wait in line.  By the time I got to the counter, there was only brisket and turkey for my 2-meat plate combo.  
The brisket is melt-in-your-mouth good!  The turkey was juicy, tasty, and very well seasoned.  
My sides - baked beans which has a little bit of kick to it, well seasoned with meat in it.  My next side - cole slaw - vegetables were crunchy and seasoned well and it wasn't too sweet or tangy.
You can also get as a free option to adorn your plate - pickles, onions, and 2 slices of bread.

Definitely will be coming back here for more of their meats that ran out, e.g. the sausage, the pork ribs, and the short ribs.  Guess next time I'll have to arrive a bit earlier!",5,2015-02-23 19:57

I still do eat meat but if they opened Green in my neck of the woods, I could definitely handle being vegan.  Most of the food, I've tried here is good, but I will always order the same thing if I go.  The eggless rolls are nice and crispy, even if they are always very greasy.  I also love the no harm chicken parm.  The ""cheese"" is really sharp and the marinara is kinda tart and goes nicely with the ""chicken"" and the cheese.  Their chili fries are amazing, and you would never know that there wasn't meat in it.    

I've tried a few of the bowls, stir-fries, etc.  They're good but not great, and nothing I would go there specifically for.  The sandwiches are where its at.  

The price is reasonable for what you get, even though prices have gone up since I've last gone.  The decor is decidedly hipster, (and so is the crowd).  But I can overlook those things for good food.",4,2008-10-05 16:36

Also, the gentleman who took my order and took our payment, didn't seem the friendliest.  Not sure, but he didn't smile at any time.  The lady who was the manager or owner was friendly and that's why I'm giving this place a 3.

Gave our name and number at the Host stand. The gal was polite. Not a long wait, and they text you instead of giving you one of their pagers (brilliant, and a cost savings for them).
We were seated and waited a long while before a very sweet gal named Kayla approached us. She offered to get us drinks, explained the menu, and said she'd get drinks and our waiter. I guess there was a little confusion  (or no one wanted a 2 top), so she came back and said that she'd be our server. 

She helped us pick dinner, we were both torn between 2 different items. My hubs got the Short Rib Stew and said it was really good (and loved the green Chiles). I was torn between the burger and the Chicken Tabouli, she suggested I get the burger and Chicken Tabouli salad as a side.
I am SO glad I did! The burger was 'meh (which surprised me, expected more knowing the name of the restaurant). The Chicken Tabouli salad was FanTasTic! Loaded with Feta cheese and almonds and all sorts of goodness.

Kayla was absolutely wonderful. She was polite, gracious, listened, and made suggestions when we asked. That is hard to find in a server and we appreciated it!

Let me just say that I was personally a little uncomfortable with this because while I have received refund/free meal offers from other businesses in the past, I've never taken them up on it.  I don't think it's about the money and I certainly don't write reviews to elicit free meals.  However, since the 3 of us split the cost of the meal evenly, I felt that it would only be fair if I took my friends' suggestions into account.

I might consider one of their rice dishes, but nothing else. The sandwiches are  extremely greasy. I've had the original ""g"" spicy po-boy, which is a buffalo chicken sandwich with some faux meat. It just tasted like grease and buffalo sauce. I got the chicago cheesesteak on another occasion to try out their seitan, and it was just a greasy mess too...greasier than the real thing. I've also had the chicken nuggs and the texture leaves a lot to be desired and is quite flavourless. I think I need to try something without the faux meats and stick to tofu or just veggies to get a good meal there. I'll probably give them one more chance for lunch by getting a rice bowl and maybe update my review at that time if it improves my impression of their food. 

I have come here for tsoynamis, and they aren't that consistent with making them. I usually get more than one, and one usually has noticeably more dessert than the other. I wish they were more consistent with these. 

The pastries are a bit pricey, so I haven't tried any of those. I bought one of those really dark energy bars though, with the semolina and stuff in it. I didn't like it at all. It was way too sweet and the texture was off. I wouldn't spend my money on it again.

Our team building was worthwhile here, thanks to drinks and some hilarious drives. 

Service was good. No issues flagging down our waitress when we needed some more drinks. She was very helpful and cool. 

The food? I took away a star just for the dry, lackluster food. We had the Thai chicken satay skewers and chicken pot stickers as appetizers. For the main course, there was the pickle fried chicken, beef brisket, green chili mac and cheese, beans, house salad with rolls. 

All of it was pretty blasé. The clear winner of the night was the beef brisket. And if we're going to talk about winners, we might as well touch on the loser, which was the green chili mac and cheese. Holy crap. It was unnecessarily dry and had very little flavor. It certainly didn't taste like any sort of chili, green or otherwise.

Aside from that, the location is easy to get to off the freeway and it's a little pricey, but it's an awful lot of fun when your target lights up at night!",4,2017-04-13 23:37

I ordered lobster tail which was served with warm butter in a dish above a candle to keep it warm. Which I loved because it made the lobster taste even more delicious. The lava cake is definitely worth it. The peach mule was not peachy at all in fact it was very limey and tasted more like a margarita. Perhaps it was made wrong but I didn't taste the peach whatsoever and for a 18 dollar cocktail I would hope for something that tastes like the description. Also, ambiance was fine but you are very close to everyone else as far as seating and it is VERY dark so seeing your food is actually really difficult. Other than that the food is great and I'll definitely come back. Good for date nights and celebratory dinners for sure but not the best place for young children. You will also spend a lot here so made sure you plan on it. For the 2 of us it was over 200 with 1 cocktail, 2 entrees, 1 side, and 2 desserts.",4,2018-04-22 7:32

We had to flag her down again just to get our bill. The restaurant wasn't busy which was strange because this was right before an event. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't good. It had no flavor.

This is what happens when you open up up fifty restaurants, you lose the quality, but in this case I'm sure that there was no quality in the first place.

We celebrated 3 birthdays with 18 people and our servers were exceptional.

We had the gyozas and peking duck as appetizers, the gyozas were very good, the Peking duck was bland.

My wife ordered the Butterfish which was very soft and tender where it practically melts in your mouth and a wonderful taste. Highly recommend this entree.

I selected the entree Roy's Quad which consisted of 4 different samples of fish, Salmon, Butterfish, Roasted Macadamia Mahi Mahi and Ahi Tuna. Very nice sampler, the Butterfish definitely stood out.

Came back a few weeks later and Roy's offered a prefixed meal for $39, an appetizer, entree and a dessert. I chose the Canoe Appetizer ($12) which included Szechuan Ribs, Spicy Tuna Roll, Lobster Potstickers, Coconut Shrimp and Chicken Satay.

I'm not sure which I liked more.. the coffee or the sweet thing my man did  He got the churro flavor and got me the flan flavor.  Both were superb but I do believe we both like the flan best.  This drink was hot, sweet and had a unique flavor. I guess it tasted just like a flan but in a drink?! Makes sense! It was really nice to have a completely new flavor unlike the normal coffee drinks we all get.  I look forward to trying more flavors!

eUFFsMQ5wX3gPCDIgc9jnw,90yx7vf32xMTfa6hEISt8Q,5FIOXmUE3qMviX9GafGH-Q,"Ah, what more can be said about this little slice of Heaven in North Tempe? Well, let me offer something from a new perspective: I am a conservative Republican Catholic and I love Green!

I often like to come here after work. It is right in the middle of my 2.2 mile commute, and so I can easily walk here, eat, and walk to the next bus stop. So if you see me in my work uniform - I work at a Catholic parish - you will know that I think it is worth the walk.

I especially enjoy coming here on Fridays, when I abstain from meat. Now I could be somewhere eating seafood or dairy or eggs, but I choose Green because the food is just that good. My motto? ""Hippies have the best food!"" Restaurants usually try to be apolitical. The key to a good restaurant is mostly in not offending anyone's ideologies. Green's decor and ambiance is clearly quirky and off-beat and appeals mostly to young hipsters, but you can tell that the only politics important here are kindness to animals and care for the environment. I can get behind these things!

I have been here many times now. It is becoming even more of a regular thing as I get used to the three-block walk in between buses. I have tried various dishes and they're all fantastic. Some of the best are the Lemon Pesto Bowl and the Chili Fries with ""Cheese"". I have also had Edamame, Samosas, and No Harm Chicken Parm, all great. Once I had a mock burger that was weird and would've been sub-standard even for Jack in the Box. But I'm happy to ignore the outliers when the rest is delish. Lately I have quite enjoyed my share of Vanilla Almond Milk Shakes. I am sure these have more than a few calories but it's definitely a refreshing treat on a hot day. And the portion isn't huge, so I don't feel that guilty about indulging.

The price is right! Everything is so reasonable, and the servers are super-friendly and nice. An especially nice feature is a big fridge full of interesting drinks, none of which I've ever tried, not to mention the fresh-mixed juices and ades on the counter. Also there is an impulse-buy set of shelves for things to take home, all of which are full of vegetarian goodness.

If you're in doubt about what to get, try my favorite. The Lemon Pesto Bowl with House Tofu and Brown Rice. You really can't go wrong. The walnuts in here are a special treat. Plenty of mixed veggies in a delectable tart lemon sauce. I like to break out the chopsticks for this one. Also, don't miss the Tsoynamis, a soft-serve treat that is also refreshing on a hot day. I tried one once and it was wonderful. But being on a diet, I shy away from sugary creamy frozen treats as a matter of course. It's not for me but perhaps it is for you!

I am known for my ability to eat just about anywhere a bus stops. I adamantly refuse to go out of my way to eat - that's why when I'm at home on my day off, I am likely to order delivery food or, in a pinch, I might walk one block to a restaurant. Green is so conveniently placed on my commute, and so delicious, that it has rightly taken its place among my regular hangouts. And I am proud to recommend them to other conservatives. Don't let your politics keep you away from really great food!",5,2014-08-03 20:30

Nice people and very interesting selection of local produce, beer, wine, etc...  Great music even!  Everytime I go here the music is wonderful.  Neat Dylan collage in the back too...I heard the story on it.  I think it was the owners album collection or something. 

The best part of all however is the BBQ!  Wonderful selection of breakfast stuff and lunch/dinner.  You can buy the brisket, pulled pork etc...by the pound too which would be great to take home one night for dinner.  It is heavenly BBQ.  Really just great.  

I feel like I am on vacation everytime I walk in this place and havent been disappointed yet.  Its so nice to see an independently owned gas station with an owner that takes every opportunity to share all of his passions with his patrons.  This is certainly not your ordinary gas station.  They have taken it to a whole new level and I admire anybody who ""re-invents"" something that we all thought that we knew everything there was to know about.

We started with the TMI Dip, which was warm cream cheese with chunks of Jalapenos and lost of tasty crispy bread. This was good; I think the dip needed a little something else to make it perfect, but a good start to our meal.

Then we shared the Mac and Cheese, and OMG was this Mac and Cheese the best I have EVER had. There was tons of good quality creamy cheese, and green chilies. WOW don't change a thing!

I order for my main meal The Sheridan, which was spicy and very good. The salami and turkey made for a really well put together sandwich.

We just had nachos but they were plentiful and mighty tasty. Big fat slices of jalapenos on top and visually appealing.

I read a past review that said: ""All I could taste throughout my meal was black pepper"" and I completely agree. S&P are always good on red meat but they put it to the extreme here. The sauce helped drown it out but I don't like much sauce on my BBQ.

Conveyor belt sushi is always a mixed bag.  It's the Winco of sushi, so you serve yourself but don't expect the quality stuff you get at your favorite place.

The draw for these is: you get to try different rolls for a minimal investment (about $2 per plate).  Between us we racked up 13 plates and it came to about $27 plus tip. 

The service here is among the worst I've seen. You get your table, your drink and then the only sound you hear is the quiet hum of the conveyor going past your table. No service at all, unless they need your table, which they did. 

Some of the better rolls, IMO: Philly, Tiger and Las Vegas.",3,2016-07-30 16:52

Nice and light and a good vibe.  The rest of the decor...clearly alot of money was put into it but it's a mix of 80's and dark decor- not my cup of tea but that's ok.

Service- good but felt like they were consistently apologizing for things.  Sorry we don't have a lunch menu yet, we haven't decided on brunch because the chef can't get it right, sorry no specials. Don't have happy hour but we're thinking about it....REALLY- no happy hour! 

Argued when we commented about the RIDICULOUSLY high prices....it's not New York!  They claimed to be inline with Houston's, Steak 44 etc but at least you don't leave there hungry!  I totally agree so many restaurants waste food and go over board- but this is the opposite extreme.  I left hungry and a couple of hundred dollars out of pocket.  

The food is very good- can't argue that but THE PORTIONS ARE TINY.  Ordered Caesar salad. It was good...little soggy but good flavor but again SMALL!  Tortellini.....fabulous but 5 MINIATURE pieces. FIVE!!!!  Glass of wine minimum $17 

Guys- you run some wonderful restaurants and this has the elements to be one of them but take the prices down a notch and increase the food portions otherwise I'm afraid you won't be around too long.",2,2017-03-22 20:20

j7ZCGJs0m_pat0qVZOH9Ug,OOrnB6q5LQX0cltbA0uuTA,#NAME?,"I've been here about 20 times, and still I rate it ""meh."" I went for these positives:  
(1) drinks - great bloody marys, mimosas, and they serve illy coffee
(2) ambiance - I love that it's light, airy & open 
(3) decor - modern clean lines
(4) service - very attentive and prompt
(5) outdoor patio access with a great outdoor bar.

The only thing I'm not thrilled about is the food. I've been pleased with the basics - an egg and toast or a plain waffle. But I can make these things at home - the point of going out, to me, is to eat something that's too troublesome for me to make myself. 
My main complaints are that the food simply is boring to taste, and they seem to think that tweaking classic dishes is imperative to their brand. But sadly, to me, their take on these classics isn't even close to how good the original is. Some examples- their BLT, Cobb salad, and baked steel cut oatmeal.
The only steel cut oatmeal they offer is baked and sliced in loaves. I tried it, and it was impossibly dry - gulping water didn't even help. 
Same with the BLT - it was oddly dry. It also had avocado on it, which is great, however, assembled, the bacon was too dry, the bread too dry, and the other veggies in the sandwich couldn't counterbalance that excessive dryness.
I didn't like the Cobb salad because it was served on field greens lettuce, instead of romaine or even iceberg. Swapping the field greens out didn't work, to me, because the texture of them didn't hold up to the other ingredients. Field greens are too delicate for the traditional Cobb salad ingredients. Again, I found the salad DRY! (How can a salad be dry!?!?) I asked for more dressing, which still didn't seem to make the plate any better.
I wasn't impressed with the omelet I ordered either, on another visit. I had the veggie omelet (onions, peppers, tomatoes, broccoli, mushrooms, cheese), but it had minimal cheese and there wasn't anything special about it - it simply wasn't flavorful. 
I know the issue isn't me because I never complain about food being dry elsewhere - I enjoy the food at First Watch, Snooze, and others and don't find their food dry at all. 

I loved taking my out of town guests here just for the ambiance and vibe, but I've since stopped because I'm just plain sick of paying for food I don't like. I end up wasting more than half my meal because after so many bites of attempting to resurrect the dish, I just give up and my appetite is spoiled. No ambiance is worth that price. I hate that I don't like their food because I love the idea of visiting with my dog on the patio, how close it is to my home, etc.
The only other negative is that they don't accept reservations. 
I've not been back in over a year, but the menu I see online looks to be the same. If the food was better, I'd probably visit every other week because it's so close to where I live, and I truly love the decor, ambiance, and patio.",2,2017-09-03 23:05

The atmosphere is lively and comfortable as well as romantic and a little elegant. Think candlelit dining room and bar, chandeliers, and comfy chairs. There is a nice outdoor dining patio as well. We had dinner at the bar which we enjoyed even better than if we had a table in the dining room. The customer service from the minute you walk in the door was phenomenal! The bartenders were very knowledgeable in their trade as well as the restaurant's menu items. Keith was a master at directing us on the house specialties for drinks as well as food.  For the meal itself, we decided to do several of the small plates rather than two entrees. 

Our meal: 
Buratta with truffle oil - delishly rich
Pork Belly with Kimchi and udon noodle - the combination of flavors was amazing
Short Ribs on a biscuit - (yes, we had pork belly and biscuits in the same sitting - don't judge!) this dish was devine

I will definitely come back just for the jade chicken. The jerk chicken was dry, I understand jerk chicken has a dry rub but it's not juicy whatsoever.

The enchiladas were impressive. I would have praised them in a full sit-down restaurant and was surprised at the quality and flavor considering Gadzooks is a ""fast casual"" kind of spot. I can't comment on every element of my dish because I ordered in such a frantic manner. I do know that I had chicken and short rib enchiladas smothered in tasty, tangy sauce and cheese. Every bite and flavor was delicious. 

The parts of the experience that were really lacking were service and signage. Though the employees were friendly, their knowledge of the product was minimal and sense of urgency was nonexistent. Just having the individual fillings, cheeses, toppings, etc. labeled would have cut down on a lot of the confusion. There is a chalkboard menu above the area where you order, but you cannot even read it unless you are standing five feet away. Places like Subway and Chipotle have had the same ten ingredients forever and people still have to hem and haw over their order. 

I'm by no means suggesting that Gadzooks should go the Subway/Chipotle route. On the contrary. They boast the thousands of flavor combinations available, and that is much appreciated. Yet in order to follow through on that promise, they need to have a precise ordering process with staff that is knowledgeable about every ingredient and can convey that information quickly and effectively. 

I'd like to see this place thrive, and I do absolutely recommend it. They've tackled the number one priority- good, quality food that is reasonably priced.

In my opinion, brisket is the mark of a great barbecue place (at least out here west of the Mississippi), and they've got it down here... the meat is fatty and tender, and it's also got a really nice char.

Given the quality of the meat, the prices are pretty reasonable too... somewhere in the neighborhood of $10-12 per person for lunch.

As others point out, if you go on a busy day, though, you may have to wait... or you may find that something you were hoping to try is sold out.

I also had the chance to try the nigiri combo plate which contains generous portion of delicious fish and a roll. Think that you will notice that it's different with the sushi joint is that they use purple rice, which adds special indescribable taste to any roll or nigiri.

I'm typically hotter than whatever the locals eat but not as hot as the natives (ie.  I can't handle Thai hot or Indian very hot).

Wish I stopped in with a group for multiple offerings but since I was alone I went for my staples.  Chicken Vindaloo with samosas and naan.

The vindaloo was spiced just right for me.  The chicken and potato stew was delightful and true to a vindaloo.

The samosas were very good as well.  I look forward to returning to try the many other offerings soon as this will be my go to Indian restaurant in North Phoenix going forward.",5,2016-07-11 9:15

We drove 30+ minutes to get there, and we were heartbroken it did not live up to the expectation :(  We really wanted to love this local favorite.  For a first-timer, the ordering sheet was pretty confusing, and most of the people were helpful in exception of one guy who was annoyed we were taking so long trying to figure out the rice bowl combination.

I ordered the Emerald Chicken + Carnitas Rice Bowl with Jerk Fried Rice + Black Beansl.  The Emerald Chicken reminded me of a twist in Hainan Chicken: refreshingly light.  The Carnita was so dry, I had to put extra salsa to moisten the pork. Jerk Fried Chicken was sadly average with the highlight being the black beans with its sweet and creamy flavor blew my mind!  The food was served room temperature borderline cold with the exception of the black beans.  

My friend ordered the Emerald Chicken + Jerk Chicken with Plain Fried Rice + Black Beans.  We both agreed on the identical protein + side dish. The Jerk Chicken had no kick or ""Island flavor""!

We hope our visit was just a anomaly.  Because of our love for both cuisines, we would give it another attemp but probably only if we are in the area.",2,2013-11-25 0:17

Thinly sliced Ribeye Marinated with onions and peppers inside the Pita which is a great combination. Once you have had that it is difficult to eat there again and not order the same thing over and over.

We generally order the hummus and Shawarma which are both very good. It is difficult to share these items but maybe just take a bite so you could have a taste of different items.

The staff is very attentive and also there to fill your drink.

The restaurant offers a wide variety of healthy items including pizza.

They make their food with special twists, like champagne and merlot infused butters with their bread. It's unique and fun to try but the bread itself was nothing special, we would've preferred regular butter with good bread. The Caesar salad has fried capers and prosciutto chips on it. Again, it sounds incredible and was good but nothing I'd crave. Creme Brûlée - ditto although the Chantilly cream was excellent.  

I will say our filet mignons were cooked perfectly and served piping hot. My husband didn't prefer the flavor of the seared edges but I thought it was good (not great).

I would think that crisis this these would happens from time to time but they acted like the whole world was collapsing and they did not know what t do... get some extra chairs and get on with it! They were beyond annoyed by this time and we were kept waiting in the lobby for them to fix this code red catastrophe (insert eye roll).Ok so on to the actual meal. Our waitress was here and there and forgot more often than forgivable. Also when we were ordering our meal she asked us if we wanted soup or salad with our entrée, in my opinion implying that it was included with the order, but guess what? Not the case. This establishment tries to act like it is some high end steak house, but they only succeed in ACTING like it. My meal was cold and the steaks were a joke. The only good review that I would give would be for their clam chowder. As we were exiting the restaurant the hostesses gave us no more than a look in our direction leaving me feeling like a second class citizen... who spent more than $500 on a below average meal.",1,2015-03-25 21:44

We were the only ones in the place, when another party arrived and were seated right next to us in this huge establishment.  The ambience was that of a night club, with strobing cord lighting under the bar, which was annoying.  The only piece of decor that alluded to being in some sort Indian restaurant was the stencil design on the brick wall.  Everything else screamed leftovers of some sort of defunct restaurant.

With only two tables in the restaurant, both orders for each party were completely messed up.  Not sure how this could happen....it's not like the place was busy!  

The whole experience was very odd, especially for a restauranteur with experience (they have a restaurant in Prescott).  First was the question about the garlic naan, and if it was too greasy after we started eating it.  Then the shenanigans with the wrong orders.  As soon as the food was placed on our table and we served ourselves, the man who may have been the owner walked over and said ""yes, that's not the chicken"" and went back to the kitchen.  Huh?  So what are we eating?

What took it over the level of ""gross"" was when one of the male wait staff came over to ask if he could taste one of the main courses we had on our table....then immediately grabbed the large spoon and dripped some of the sauce in the center of his hand and LICKED IT! ""Yes, that's the Coconut Lamb!"" All right in front of us!  My husband and I looked at each other and thought is this really happening?  Horribly disgusting! We didn't order the Coconut Lamb, the other table did.  

On a side note, the Basmati rice was greasy, dull and had lots of clumps, which if made fresh should be light, fluffy but slightly firm and aromatic.  This had the consistency of generic Minute Rice.  

The quality of the meat, lamb and chicken, was mediocre.  The tastiness and spice complexity to the dishes was very bland.  While not a major connoisseurs of Indian cuisine, both my husband and I felt this place was no contestant in comparison to other establishments we've enjoyed on the west coast.  Even if the dinner was uneventful, $51 is steep for the portions and quality.

While we did take what we didn't eat home, we did toss it after questioning the restaurant's hygiene practices.  We didn't complain and make a spectacle, as this isn't our style, but we will not come back again.",1,2017-07-23 17:10

Got a two item combo (one green chicken + one red chicken) and a bottom-less soft drink for about $11.  Waited almost 15 minutes for my order - and the food arrived at room temperature and tasted like it had been sitting around.  How can you fail to serve heated food?  My chicken items were dried out.  The accompanying black beans were literally a puree with a few (unmelted) flakes of shredded cheese.  Your meal is served in a circular tin - mine arrived as basically an unappetizing room temp mess.  At least the soda is bottom-less and the meal came with a decent freebie sugary cookie (at least the cookie was somewhat warm).  This place is a mere shadow of former greatness...

B-RLw-FPpi-HiaQLBQ7PwA,Q6Dcxo3_lNCzkqK7J3FL7A,S-oLPRdhlyL5HAknBKTUcQ,"Best sushi I've ever eaten in Phoenix!  I came here for lunch today with a friend.  At first we were a little confused by the set up because we were expecting a traditional sit down restaraunt.  At this place you either pick up a pre-packaged sushi combo or you order at the counter (at least that's how it works for lunch).

I chose their Sushi Combo A for $10.  It was a great value and came with 2 tuna and 4 salmon and a california roll.  One thing you will notice right away is that their rice is PURPLE!  Unique and interesting, although it really just tasted like regular rice to me.  They have an explanation for why the rice is purple showing on their TV monitor, but I didn't take the time to read it...

For the fish - the quality was EXCELLENT.  The tuna was a deep dark red and very moist.  The salmon was fatty, buttery goodness.

For the service - everyone was very nice.  The owner is very hands on and checks in to make sure you are enjoying everything.  He even delivered a flaming roll to one table, which was quite the show!

I will 100% be back here again.  Can I come back tonight??

The only con - no parking lot.  You will have to find a metered spot on the street, but there are a ton of them right nearby so it's not a huge inconvenience.",5,2014-02-14 20:36

Yes joyful! I even got up from my table to go back and chat with her for a few mins. Keep sparkling and doing the damn thang girl! Yasssss.

We also had an amazing waitress but I don't know how to spell her name tho(sad face). She checked on us just enough and made sure we actually were enjoying our food. 

Ok on to the food. My kiddo and I split the shrimp appetizer which was delicious, chopped salad(champagne dressing) was so good along with the fish and fries. The fish was light and not heavy but needed the vinegar or whatever you fancy and the fries were delicious... lol. We really enjoyed our food. Rest of the group had burger, grilled cheese, prime rib sandwich and the mac n cheese. They all raved how good the food was. When you are out numbered by hungry teens taller then you make sure you feed them good food folks!

The selection is mostly breakfast foods and a small lunch menu.  I got there and there was a line out the door.  WHOA!  The ordering line moved pretty quick.  It is nice to have menus posted where you wait in line, so read up, decide, and order when it is your turn.  

I was craving the french toast.  Their version is french baquette, hand cut & dipped in vanilla custard.  And served with a side of applewood bacon.  I also ordered a side of the rosemary potatoes.  I am sucker for potatoes, I just LOVE them.  After ordering, you get your cup and go to the island of drinks (coffees, teas, & sodas).  You get your own utesiles, napkins, etc.  And then pick a seat.  

M picked a 2 seater table.  Sweet!  The employee check on us and see how we are doing.  The sweetest people that work there!!  Our food came and it was pretty good.  One of three my pieces of french toast was on the hard side.  The poatoes were pretty good, nothing too special.  

There was a group sitting next to us (they were split up because of the amount of people they had).  They kept looking at us to move but we did not.  We are enoying our breakfast, we did not even finish our food YET.  Then just just kept looking at us.  Really?  Finally they moved another table so they can all sit together.  I got refills and came back, we chatted for a little bit then another family member was standing over our table.  He asked us to move so he can sit his group.  We just left the place.

sy_xMERzc4eqLD8wG8zeIg,CkM9FtxelvahpE9StyON3A,MgHWbwuxxb_txhI3lK_bKg,"Old houses turned into hip and modern restaurants are just so cool, and The Main Ingredient Ale House & Cafe in central Phoenix is no exception. And it's hard to find a place in the States that serves Coca-Cola Light, so it gets points for that alone.

The dark and cozy eatery looks like it could be a romantic spot because the lighting inside is so low, but it's actually more casual in that it has sports broadcasting on a television in the dining room, and the bar is stocked with more than 30 beers from around the country and a variety of wines. This would be a great place to come before a game downtown if you want to chill out but still want to be a part of culture, since it's in the historic Coronado district.

The food menu at The Main Ingredient is simple and stocked with salads, sandwiches and American staples such as mac n' cheese. Everything that came out looked really high-quality, and my food was delicious.

First, I really enjoyed the chips and salsa ($4), with chips from yummy local La Tolteca and a medium heat salsa. The chips had the perfect texture and consistency, and the salsa had the right amount of spiciness. They definitely rivaled some of the best chips and salsa I've had at Mexican food restaurants, which is no surprise considering they're from La Tolteca.

For my entree, I got the griddled cheese with a  side of greens ($7). Instead of the sourdough it usually comes on, I got the sandwich on focaccia and added avocado to go along with the tomato. Be sure to pair your sandwiches with the greens rather than the kettle chips-I added a delicious lemon vinaigrette to the greens, and they were amazing. I could have eaten that salad as the whole meal, it was so delicious-if you don't like salads, this will make you a believer. The focaccia made the sandwich mouth-wateringly good, and for the price, I thought it was an excellent value.

Besides the tasty food, The Main Ingredient also features a little patio, and it's definitely a central Phoenix gem that's worth checking out.",4,2012-07-07 21:31

I liked the Ichiro Jersey hanging on the wall towards the back of the restaurant. Also. Nice to have a carafe of ice filled water, loved the metal cups that kept the water super cold.

We ordered the Tapas - Pork Gyozas, Tonkatsu Ramen and the Shio Ramen. When ordering the Ramen, would suggest requesting the soft boiled egg that comes with it or they will give you a hard boiled egg.

The broth for the ramen was very good, nice and hot. You could order the ramen with either the straight noodles which are made in house daily or the curled egg noodles. We tried each with different ramen and both were very good.

Tonkotsu Ramen consist of 
Pork broth, pork chashu, green onion, kikurage, seasoned egg, fish powder, sesame. Served with straight noodles

Shio Ramen consist of Pork broth, pork chashu, green onion, menma, seasoned egg. Served with straight noodles

Pork Gyozas are Pan fried pot stickers with pork and veggies, served with ponzu sauce.

I brought a book and some paper to read and take notes for homework and arrived backpack in hand, and hungry for a hearty breakfast. southwestern breakfast burrito sounds delicious, chorizo, eggs, and jalepeno cream cheese?! I'll take it.  disappointed with the meaty-cheesy hashbrowns from last time, I went with the rosemary potatoes as suggested to me by the owner regarding my last yelp review. counter girl informs me sorry, we're out of rosemary potatoes. shock, gasp, awe. went for their signature hashbrowns again, reluctantly. regular coffee. $14.50. my jaw nearly hit the floor. scramble could stand to reduce their prices a little. 

my order arrived about ten minutes later, almost too hot to dig in at first. i sat at the window on a stool, which was quite comfortable, and enjoyed the rainy morning. dug into the hashbrowns first, drizzled with some cholula. they were a lot better than last time, and i enjoyed every last bite of them. as for the burrito, i tried it at first without the jalepeno cream cheese, salsa, or sour cream, because they all came on the side. what was, for one bite, a seemingly bland breakfast burrito, became a spicy breakfast sensation with all of the aforementioned sides spread across it. 

it began to get loud in there, and people everywhere i go seem to have this habit of sitting next to me with their talkative and annoying children when they can see I'm clearly engaged in an intellectually stimulating activity that stands to be disrupted abruptly by your obnoxious toddler. the place is huge, and there are plenty of open seats and cartoons tuned on their abundant flat screen tvs. i left after about 10 minutes of attempting to tolerate messy loud children, and enjoyed a smoke out on their large patio.

overall, a better dining experience, but a little expensive for my college student budget. the wait staff was friendly, and the place is filled with cute girls to make you blush. i would love to see more combination plates, like how with the omelette comes with a choice of two sides. it would be awesome to get pancakes, bacon, and eggs altogether for a set [lower] price than ordering everything a-la-carte. at least, that's how I prefer my breakfast: hearty.",3,2009-09-05 23:50

They seem to specialize in signature grilled cheese but I think ""signature"" must translate into ""contains bacon"" as 3 of the 5 options had that as a key ingredient.   I had the bacon and jalapeño. It was tasty but fell short in the heat category and was a bit on the grilled but not crisp category. Service was prompt and friendly, but the music on the small patio was a little bit loud for a good conversation. 

I will come back and give it a try. They do have happy hour from 11-6 pm which includes some featured tapas along with $5 wines by the glass",3,2014-10-04 2:32

My husband and I are sushi lovers and are always trying new sushi restaurants. We traveled 40 minutes from Surprise to try this out. We were disappointed.

The rice they use is black/purple and DOES NOT taste like sushi rice. It doesn't taste right and it makes the rolls taste abnormal. At every sushi restaurant, we always make sure we get the rainbow roll to gauge the quality of their raw fish.Their raw fish is okay.. definitely not great quality, but not the worst either.

If you love rolls with lots of sauce, then this place is for you. I, personally, don't like TOO MUCH sauce on my specialty rolls... just a little is enough for me. But they DRENCH those suckers so much that all you taste is sauce with weird black/purple rice. 

There DINNER MENU is very small... and does NOT include bento boxes. All they have are rolls, sashimi, ramen, and the typical appetizers. Their LUNCH menu, on the other hand, have bento boxes.

Last but not least, the PRICE is a little more than what I'm used to for the same quality. The ""SPECIAL"" we were offered for uni/sea urchin was $5 per ONE piece. That's a little expensive. I can get good uni/sea urchin at ""Sushi Catcher"" for $8 per TWO large pieces. 

FYI, be prepared to pay for parking since it is located downtown-ish. It costs $1.50 per hour for meter parking.

We won't be going back.",1,2014-12-24 21:04

You know, one of those local joints that Guy Fieri raves about....This is their second location. It's tucked in the way back of a strip mall. Your GPS may lead you to the wrong location just an FYI. After finally finding this place, we walked into a large, 'clean', restaurant, set up like a high school cafeteria. The tables are plastic portable tables. The wall decor is mostly posters tacked up on the walls with thumb tacks like a teenagers bedroom. Place was not busy at 6:30 on a Friday,. However, the girl at the register was impatient with us like there was an invisible line behind us that only she could see... it would have been nice if she would have asked if this was our first time, explain things to us and give us samples. The food combinations kinda make the place smell funny like the sewer was backing up...  I dunno, maybe i just have an overly sensative nose. My hubby didn't notice it at all....You are probably thinking, ""where is she going with this review?!? Well here I go to the most important part...the food!! The ordering system is a bit weird. I guess there are millions of options, but only a few are pictured on the wall behind the counter. When it arrives to your table, it's in a round disposable tinfoil container, perfect for take home transport! I had a rice bowl with red jade chicken and fried rice. Yum!! The fried rice was really good, a bit different from, let's say the Panda variety;) The red jade chicken had great flavor but was a little dried out like it was pre-made and sitting under a heat lamp for hours. My hubby got the combo plate with plain fried rice, black beans, jerk chicken and machaca. All of which he devoured like he'd never ate before! He said it was all fantastic! I tried some of his plate and I would have to agree! Best part of the meal, the giant snicker doodle cookies, made fresh!

The big wac feels way too dense for me but the taste is pretty good. The Mac and cheez is probably the best vegan one you'll have. My only true complaint is that if you order anything with chopped veggies they give you giant hunks that aren't even cooked all the way through. It's very annoying.

I'm not a big fan of chains or franchises -- even smaller ones -- but I'm also committed to giving any place a chance. Since that rainy day introduction some (three?) years ago, I've never really had a 'bad' Oregano's experience. But, that being said, part of the Oregano's experience is the long dining time which, on a weekend, generates longer waits for a table. So that's Oregano's. 

The Camelback location has been our 'home' Oregano's since we moved to Phoenix. The parking here is a little tight and you'll often find yourself pulling up to the curb on one of the streets behind the restaurant. But the staff is great and there is adequate seating for your pre-meal wait. That all said, my go-to here is the meatball sub or the Big Bambino salad.

I was planning on ordering an iced tea, but was then informed by our server that draft beers were $2.50. Since the beer was the same price as an iced tea, I decided to go for the beer which was Sonoran White Chocolate Ale (one of my faves).

Our sandwiches were served quickly. They both came on flavorful herbed focaccia. Mine had a delicious mix of grilled vegetables including: mushrooms, squash, and roasted red pepper with a flavorful goat cheese spread.

Don't come in, expecting gluten-free, vegan, organic or anything healthy whatsoever. This is the place to come if you want to indulge!

This place is so under the radar its not even funny.  What a gem hidden away in an unassuming strip mall.  

Greeted quickly, WE were asked where WE wanted to sit. Can you believe it? We were then asked how we were doing, and we ordered drinks, including a much too small Thai iced tea. 
Waters were brought our without asking (points scored right there) and a carafe of ice water was left on the table (more points again).  My sons water came in a to- go cup with a lid, also much appreciated. 

Spice level 4/5 was perfect for me, but I am the type if person who puts Sriracha on everything. 

The Tom Kha kicked my butt it was so good.   It was served in white clam shell shaped bowl and is enough to share.  It was packed with fresh semi crunchy veggies and thin flat strips of chicken. The spices were dead on. I have been to other Thai places that make their soup all about the heat. 

What surprised me the most was the fried ice cream for dessert.  Enough to share among four people, the outer donut shell was chewy and sweet while the chocolate syrup with perhaps a cherry sauce was a great way to end the evening.  It",4,2015-09-07 14:23

I ordered the combo plate since I wanted to try a wider variety of what they had.  I got their ginger chicken, the jade chicken, the pork fried rice, and the black beans and jerk fried chicken wrapped into a burrito. 

Ginger chicken: awesome
Jade chicken: awesome
Pork fried rice: great but not something you eat just by itself, you've got to mix it up with everything else 
Black beans: omg - these are great.  I'm not sure why but they tasted like pizza tomato sauce but hey, pizza tomato sauce tastes good too.

I'll be back again, it was pretty good and while I was sitting at the picnic tables (the plastic folding tables rock) I read up on the history of Chino Bandido online and it's just an all around great story of a super successful family owned establishment that came up with a unique menu and hit a home run.

The humming bird drink was really good. 

Reason why this would have just been 2 stars...

-the food was nothing special. It tasted good but it was not out of this world kind of good.
-the food portions are small and expensive.
-the food did not come out all at once. People literally all ate at different times and some people waited 45 minutes for their plate which made eating for others who got their meal early, a little awkward.
-no one actually came to say why there was a delay or apologized for the delay.
-it took forever to get the bill as well.

Think of it as a Panda Express and Taco Bell sharing the same building, only they're totally down to mix up items. You want machaca over fried rice? Sure. Terriyaki chicken quesadilla? Not even a problem. The goal is to satisfy both cravings for $10, and I don't think that can be done anywhere else. 

I prefer to uh...keep my food separated, with a rice bowl and a small quesadilla. ""You could have saved money by making it a combo!"" they said as my food was brought. Too bad no one pointed that out as I handed in the multiple choice test that was my order. I came here to eat, not to fill out paperwork!

Diners rave about the Jade Chicken, and I don't think it's half bad. It's taste is vaguely orange and is a tad on the oily side, and looks and tastes like sweet and sour cut with buffalo sauce...which is weird, but works. Top it off with a bite-sized cheese crisp, a cookie, and perhaps even a reasonably-priced craft beer! 

On your way out, feel free to grab one of the mock Chinese T-Shirts...it's politically correct, but when the rest of the decor looks decades old, I at least appreciate the antiquity of the establishment as a whole.

Positives:
If we are comparing apples to apples here (which is how I like to rate) it beats any other Italian place I've been to, of the common chain type. Why not 5 stars? With that being said, I have had some mom and pop Italian places that are absolutely unbeatable. We do not go to Olive Garden as it is bland. Oreganos? Anything but bland! They pack in the flavor on every dish I have ever had. I cook with a lot of flavor and I also expect to get it when I eat out. I don't do blah.  I love the degree of flavor this place dishes out. 

I got the Riga Tony (yes that's how they spell it here) and added meatballs. The fact that I finished my entire huge plate is a good sign. Or a bad one depending on how you look at it lol.  Full of flavor. My mom got the scampi pasta dish which was wonderful but it def has a spicy kick to it! My sister got the thin crust pepperoni pizza which was good. And no.. They didn't forget the pepperoni it's under the cheese! Haha. We wanted to finish strong with the calories so we got a pazzuki (cookie pizza with ice cream. SOO good. They bring out the cookie hot and a tad underdone to perfection.  We had a great server.

They make their own bread here, $8 a loaf, a bit steep, but you pay for freshness and quality. I think a good time to buy goodies is probably in the afternoon, you can buy them at a discounted price. I'd like to try their pretzels, they look so good, but you have to pre-order them.

We've tried a few different dishes, all of which were great, but judging by the quality of what we've gotten, it seems to be the kind of place where one could safely order just about anything on the menu and not be disappointed.  

Our favorite items are the veggie spring rolls and the vegetarian Pho with tofu.  The spring rolls are made of tofu, cucumber, bean sprouts, and mint wrapped in rice paper.  The ingredients are so fresh and delicious and there's just the right amount of mint to add the necessary flavor to set these veggie spring rolls apart from so many others.  They're served with a peanut hoisin sauce and we like to add a bit of the red chili sauce to it to give it a bit of spice. The Pho (item P7 on the menu) is so flavorful and in addition to the rice noodles, has baby bok choy and broccoli in it.  It's served with a plate of bean sprouts, thai basil, cilantro, jalepenos, and lime and is some of the best Pho that we've ever had.  

It's certainly telling that the restaurant is busy even when we go for a late lunch at 2pm.  If you're looking for excellent Vietnamese food, this is definitely a place that you shouldn't miss!",5,2011-06-17 19:09

The place wasn't crowded, but our server acted overworked and it took us ages to get drinks. After we got drinks, it took even longer before she came back to take our orders. We sat with our empty drinks, waiting to order and waiting for refills for an absurd amount of time. Our server didn't resurface until we asked another nearby server for refills - this lady seemed to be able to handle her six tales just fine, but our server couldn't handle two. Finally we got our orders in and she asks if we want refills. Are you kidding me? Of course we do - its just diet soda! Drinks were brought to us while nearby tables were being bussed - as in, dirty plates were put on pause, our glasses fetched, then the bussing resumed. We finally noticed there was a party of some kind with the servers and buss-boys in the other section of the restaurant. We watched as our server sat with friends and ate for a bit while we waited for our food and, again, went without refills. Bussers sat dirty plates on clean tables, next to the clean glasses and whatnot, which was totally inappropriate. When we did get refills, our server never took any glasses away, so our take got really crowded... especially when the food finally came. I very nearly started sitting glasses on the clean table next to us, because hey, thats what the bussers did. Our orders were wrong, but our server never came back to ask how our food was. My sister's burger was not cooked to order, all my sides were incorrect, and we were starving. My sis sent hers back (took another twenty minutes to get it corrected). I didn't bother asking about my sides, because I knew I might never see any food at all if I sent it back to the kitchen. I'm surprised my sister did. We begged another refill off another server and didn't see our server again until she dropped off the check. 
The only reason why I'm giving two stars instead of one is because our server did take my sister's meal off the check since it had been incorrect. Unfortunately.... I have a feeling she did it not because the meal had been wrong, but because she suddenly realized with her terrible service, we wouldn't be tipping.

This is a hipster-crepe paradise.  Really nice, young staff working.  Food is fresh-tasting and not overpowering.  And overall experience was good.

When you enter, you seat yourself and someone visits to let you know to order at the register. Quick process, though the orientation could have been a bit smoother with a sign up front.  We also struggled to find a table big enough for four-- couple two-tops available in different areas, so we went with a three-top and used a lap.  You also get some snack granola that we liked.

We had the Breakfast Buro, Smokey, Curd, and Vanilla Crepe.  Smokey was the best of the bunch. Habenero sauce I added to the Buro added heat without flavor. The Vanilla crepe had very little vanilla or chocolate (add-on) flavor, but was still worthy overall.

We both tried the enchiladas Christmas style, both preferred the red to the green sauce. They were both good, but the green was a little more tart than I like and a little less heat driven than I like. I  had the corn tortillas with green chile pork and one with the cornbread. The tortillas held up nicely and tasted fresh. The GCP was good, didn't jump out at me but had decent flavor and was tender. The cornbread enchilada? That was like dessert, in a good way. I could probably eat nothing but the cornbread and be happy. I'm not a huge fan of piling on toppings and went simple with just cheese and the slaw. I had also been warned that two tacos or enchiladas was plenty of food and it's easy to get too much on top and not be able to finish your meal. That seemed like a horror to me, lol. The slaw added a nice crunch to the food, was slightly sweet from the honey and didn't try to compete with any of the other flavors. My son also had the GCP and loaded his with cheese, red & green, fried egg, pico and guac. He was very satisfied with all of his selections and said he would definitely go back to mix and match in the future.

About the mix and match- this is definitely part of the appeal and helps you get a unique experience. Note, which would have been helpful to us- You can put as many fillings as you want in a taco or enchilada. Hmmmm. I definitely see some variations in the future. 

The salads were large and chopped freshly for each customer. This is an interesting twist on just getting greens with stuff on top. 

Gadzooks is a bit of a drive but definitely worth it. It was very busy on a Friday at lunch time. I would guess there were 15 people in front of us and the tables appeared full inside and out, but the line moved quickly, the tables were bussed quickly and we were able to find a spot indoors.

My mom and I were really impressed with how cozy and welcoming it is inside, and the tasty drink selections.  ALSO--this is big for me as a lactose intolerant person who loooves fancy drinks--they carry Lactaid milk.  I know other places offer non-dairy alternatives and that's fine (Tres Leches does too), but I hate how non-dairy milk alternatives like soy and almond change the flavor of the drink when that's not what I'm going for.  I just don't want to die when drinking my fancy drink.  So Tres Leches Cafe offers lactose free dairy milk with their tasty coffee and I'm a huge fan!  Parking is pretty limited (like, very....you should park on Roosevelt or Grand and walk over), but since I ALSO love Treehouse Bakery, I make it a point to visit both places (this is why I'm not skinny), and park in the big parking lot next door.   I'm hoping in the future they can work out a deal to rent a few spots from the corner parking lot owner and all would be much better.

The broth was so delicious and it was loaded with scallops, king crab, mussels, some sort of pasta, and some other delicious seafood. It was a big enough portion that two people could easily split it. It comes with some bread so you could soak up the broth. If you come here on a Friday night I highly recommend you try the King crab cioppino.",5,2011-04-04 20:20

My boyfriend and I went for date night. Right when we walked in, we got sat down right away. BUT 15 minutes later,  our waiter was no where to be found nor knew who was our waiter. I had to ask who our waiter was. One, she didn't speak English nor I can comprehend. Two, she kept smiling at me when I was talking to her,  she didn't listen to what I say.  honestly, whenever I had a question or command something,  I had to ask TWICE!!! Smh. 
These couple came in 30 minutes after us, THEY GOT THEIR FOOD BEFORE US. I confronted the manager, he did not care, he said don't worry.  It'll come out.. wtf are you serious?  


And, Whatttt? No hot sauce or ranch? Yeah. I was bummed out.

Overall. Horrible customer service. But I love my pizza .",1,2013-11-30 5:25

My breakfast of choice (as of right now, anyway) is their bacon and mushroom omelet with the roasted potatoes, wheat toast with a dab of butter, and a large iced chai tea. Love! They have lunch options as well, not just breakfast -- come hungry! 

If you arrive and the line is out the door, don't worry -- it moves quickly. Place your order, grab your number and find a seat. They bring your meal to you after it's been made.  

Seating is available inside or outside on a cute patio. Inside, one end has a couple TVs. For singles, there's great counter seating at the window overlooking the patio. The patio is dog-friendly.",5,2012-11-19 5:01

They clearly have a consistency issue here though.  One reviewer stated their burger was undercooked and mine was overcooked.  I would have traded for the undercooked any day.  That's when you get the moistest tastiest meat.  The burger could have used a little more seasoning but it was still good overall.  The onion rings and french fries were so crispy and delicious!  These alone would have me coming back when I am feeling a cheat day. 

I think this place is a decent value overall.  Habit's combos are fairly priced but I avoid soda like the plague so the a la cart options are for me. For $6.43, I got a double burger and a massive order of onion rings.  At five guys we are almost at $10 for the same meal and I don't think they are that much better.

The Pork Queso was very good, lots of flavor but the chips not good. We ordered the pork  tenderloin special and had a lot of problems the dish. Pork had a nice taste from the marinade but was over cooked. The butter nut risotto was more of a soggy rice dish than a fresh risotto. Way over priced for quality and quantity of the dish.

Service was good at the start and then he disappeared. Not once did he check in on how we liked the dish. 

My main problem was the atmosphere and how loud it was. They have speakers pointing down over the tables with loud music. It raises the sound level and soon everyone is screaming over the music and each other. Add to that a happy hour and it carries a loud bar atmosphere and not one of a restaurant.

One of my biggest pet peeves about this place (that I used to overlook, but no more) is that the wait staff is inattentive. They are usually nice, but inattentive. They never bring you water with your alcohol (which actually causes them to lose money - the more hydrated you are, the more drinks you order). They don't check to see how your food is. You could finish your whole meal just waiting for them to bring you malt vinegar. They don't clean your plates when you're done eating. It takes forever to get your 2nd round of drinks. This last visit, I was charged for drinks I didn't even order and had to wait forever for our server to come by so I could have her re-ring the check, which again took forever. 

We ordered our usual this last time (fish and tri-tip sliders). Neither of them were as good as I had remembered from previous visits. 

The thing that sucks is that we invited some friends to join us for happy hour. They had never been to Fibber's before. My friend, who is more ""observant"" than me, pointed out all the places on the walls & ceiling where the decor was dusty, falling apart and just junky. Someone in management needs to pay attention to the details. Needless to say, our friends were not impressed and doubt they'll ever go back with us. Of course, after this last experience, I'm not sure we'll ever go back anyway.",2,2012-07-30 22:03

If you want cheap, fast, and delicious Mexican food in the area, this is the winner. I've tried both a bowl (jam packed with fillings and had plenty enough leftover for lunch the next day) and burrito (THOSE. TORTILLAS.) and you can't lose either way.

The menu is small, which I think is a plus. Focus on a small number of items and do them well and you're winning. Choose either steak or chicken (or just bean and cheese) and choose them in taco, burrito, quesadilla (THESE LOOK HUGE AND AMAZING) or bowl form. Mix-ins include refried beans, rice, pico, lettuce, pickled red onions (YES!) and guac. I will say, and guys, please don't pull my Millenial card, but the guac is meh. It's a runny sauce-type avo spread. Just not my style. Everything else? SO GOOD. The salsa bar has this amazingly-garlicky verde salsa that I want to bathe in.

Cocktails came and my partners drink was fabulous. A rum cocktail w muddled fruit that she said was great. We toasted the evening and I noticed that my vodka tonic was not quite right.

We came back another night to see if it would be a better experience than happy hour, which it was. They had a really fun band that night and the stage is above the bar so it was pretty cool.

The fries were alright, def nothing special.

If someone blindfolded you and took you here, you wouldn't know you were in a strip mall. The decor is slightly hodge-podge, but a lot nicer than you would expect.

I've been here about half a dozen times and have yet to be disappointed. While it's not my favorite Pho, this place is quite good. They are very accommodating and will pretty much make the dishes however you like. The service is really good - but if it's busy, you may have to exercise a little patience.

I love the egg rolls and the spring rolls were tasty as well. Other Pho places I've been call the fried ones Spring rolls and the non-fried ones Summer rolls, but this place calls the non-fried ones spring rolls. Whatever, just get their sampler platter and enjoy...

There's not much to complain about - it's close, it's clean, good service, and the food is good. I can't explain why I have only been there a handful of times since I've lived about two blocks away from this location since forever. This place doesn't quite make the 5 star mark because I've had slightly better Vietnamese food and because it's located in a spot that should be a Mailboxes Etc.

I wasn't optimistic we'd find a dessert spot downtown that late on a week night.  But low and behold, Yelp saved the day and helped me find this place just a few blocks from my apartment.  They've only been open about 2 months, but per the Yelp reviews already seemed to be garnering a fan base.  The place sits in a historic home pretty much in the heart of First Fridays territory.  In case you get lost looking for this place, just look for the neon ""Munchies"" sign.

When we walked in it was just the owner (who also happens to be the owner of JoBot Coffee).  Super nice guy.  They don't make their own ice cream, but rather have it made by a local co-op.  Their flavors range from Chocolate Raspberry to Chips & Salsa.  After sampling seemingly every flavor, I went with a scoop of Cinnamon and a scoop of Vanilla Birthday Cake.  When you order a cup as I did, you don't get a cup but rather a Chinese noodle box complete with fortune cookie.  Random?  Yup.  But freaking awesome.  She got the Chocolate Superfarm and the Raspberry.  There's no seating inside, but there's plenty on the front porch.  We were the only ones there (not surprisingly since it was so late on a Tuesday), but thoroughly enjoyed the ice cream and overall experience.

I needed to come back and write another review for yall and here's why: you are all spectacular. Every one of you. Every staff member I've encountered, everything on your menu, the atmosphere, every single thing. Even the things that I typically don't enjoy (your meatloaf is amazing and I hate meatloaf). On Yelp I am considered a regular at Arrogant Butcher because I stop by on a weekly basis (even though its usually just for your dessert 90% of the time). I always order the caramel pudding- I swear I tell everyone how amazing the pudding is and literally it makes me happy just to eat that lol there's crack in there, yall. 

So I wanted to tell you what happened yesterday. I reached a really low point in my life (I will exclude the details), and I needed to get out of the apartment. I didn't want to be alone but I didn't want to call a friend and I was so upset that I was in tears. I pulled myself together and went downstairs to The Arrogant Butcher to make myself happy with that pudding again. I sat down outside by myself at a table for two within 5 minutes time even though it was clearly busy. My waiter came around and asked me what I wanted but I could barely speak words so I told him to surprise me with whatever dessert and whatever drink and he brought me the most thoughtfully created dessert platter- consisting of: Blueberry Cheesecake, Hot Chocolate Cake, and Caramel Pudding with a Blood Orange Paloma to wash it all down- it was a presentation! The platter had hand written labels differentiating the desserts with spoons to go along each and even a smiley face :) 

The thing is that even though it was a busy time at TAB, they stopped at nothing to make me feel like I was the only person there, while simultaneously handling the busy crowd around me and I felt 300% better after leaving. I'm never going to stop coming here.

Dessert & Drink Details: 
Blueberry Cheesecake: Cheesecake served in a mason topped with blueberry compote and graham cracker streusel.
Hot Chocolate Cake: A warm chocolate cake concoction (I can't ever tell if there's caramel in the middle but it sure tastes like it and is amazing- perhaps just a really moist center?), topped with a homemade sweet vanilla whip (Chantilly). Served in a mason.
Salted Caramel Pudding: A thick salty-sweet caramel flavored pudding topped with a sweet vanilla whip (Chantilly also?) and crack sprinkles, I swear. Served in a mason. 
Blood Orange Paloma: A clever mix of a grapefruit flavored Izze (that's the spritz), blood orange liquor, lime, and tequila.

My friend J and I must have gotten there just in time (around 10:40 on Saturday) because there was a good sized line already and it kept growing and growing. We walked right up to what we thought was the back of the line and were questioned by a couple guys if this was our first time while everyone else just stared. Turns out that was the front of the line... To the back we go! Note: the line starts by all of the outdoor seating (southside). 

Anyway, we waited for what seemed to be about 40 minutes with our hunger growing exponentially by the minute. We finally found ourselves standing outside of that little plastic curtain that separates the desperate from the confident. We could finally see meat. Hell we have been smelling delicious smoked goodness for the past 40 min, WE COULD FINALLY SEE THE MEAT! The line moved forward and we were finally in. We made it. The owner was behind the counter cutting meat like a mad man with surgical precision. You are not paying for fat and other shit. You pay for the real thing here. So much meat. So much variety. 

Although the owner was busy trimming away, he had plenty of time to entertain and jest with the customers. He had this almost sarcastic sense of humor about him that kept things lively in there. It was cool to see someone that involved in their passion and business. Waiting in line can make people grumpy, that is why the owner likes to hand out samples! What the hell is this ""fatty brisket"" that I keep hearing about? 

Boom. Here is my opportunity. This is it. Here we go.

 ***Please excuse me while I have the first BBQ induced seizure ever recorded*** 

There was no sauce. It didn't need sauce. What the hell kind of BBQ doesn't need sauce!? Why did it just melt like that? I hardly even had to chew it. What the fuck is going on?! 

That was easily one of the top 10 things I have ever put in my mouth. 

I don't think this is BBQ, people. This is something else. Either every ""BBQ"" meal I have ever had has been completely wrong, or this place is just selling something superior and calling it ""BBQ"". Either way this place is way out of the league. It is not fair for other BBQ places. It is the equivalent of a teenager beating up a five year old. But hey, I'm not complaining!

I digress though, I ended up getting the pulled pork sandwich and have no regrets. I will be back. I will get more. This place is clean, well-run, and the BBQ is dripping with passion and love. Come see for yourself.

After being seated at our table, we were hit up by the manager for a new bar-bill total. Their mistake. This was a bit uncomfortable and looked to the surrounding tables as if we tried to pull a fast one. Not a comfortable situation. It seemed to me as if they might have taken the small hit instead of coming to our table asking for a couple of dollars. 
 
The other issue involved virtually non-existent ADA restroom access for a person in a wheelchair. This is huge for injured persons in wheelchairs and if you happen to be a para or quadrapaligic, forget about it. First, you will not be able to get into the bathroom stall unless you are quite creative and then, when leaving, you will find the main door opens inward and even if you are able to get hold of the handle in the small space provided, you won't be able to open it and move your chair at the same time. Imagine having to ask someone walking by to open the door to the bathroom door so you can get back to your table

With all the ADA tools available, an upscale establishment like this should pony up for a push button door control!",3,2014-09-22 0:06

The staff at Juan's Authentic Mexican Food is warm, friendly, and extremely accommodating, which is why I feel terrible for calling out their Mexican food as bland. I really wanted to like Juan's so badly, especially after reading so many positive reviews. However, the food in my opinion just isn't good.

This was my second visit to Juan's Authentic Mexican Food Restaurant, and for me the food is just so-so. Just one step above what you would be served in a fast food establishment.

I enjoy starting my meal with chips and salsa just like everyobe else.  The salsa at Juans is like a watery tomato puree posing as salsa and the chips tasted stale. For my entrée I choose the Beef Flatas and Mexican rice, both of which had very little taste.  The meal was just very disappointing and took over 30 minutes to serve.

Juan's isn't the worst but I'm not in a rush to visit again",2,2015-08-29 18:03

I ordered off of the Restaurant Week menu so my meal came with an appetizer, entree and dessert. The tabbouli salad was nothing like typical middle eastern tabbouli (still not sure why they called it that) but it was good and flavorful. The portion of the salad was huge and I was able to share it with the entire table. For entree, I ordered the crab stuffed chicken. To me, it was a little dry and the flavors weren't amazing. My husband ordered the scallops on the regular menu and although the portion was a nice size, he didn't care for the flavor. His dish came with bacon wrapped sweet potatoes and green beans, which I thought were the best part. The salted caramel pudding dessert was by far my favorite part of the dining experience and I would definitely come back for that again. Apparently it has won awards over the years.

Overall, I thought this place was just okay. I know this is a Fox restaurant but I prefer the food and upbeat environment at Culinary Dropout (Tempe).",3,2015-09-22 18:33

A little hole in the wall that I wish were closer to home!!  

The menu offers a nice selection of what I would consider more authentic food. Not what I would consider the typical ""Americanized"" dishes. 

Ordered the Green Onion Pancakes and Steamed Pork Dumplings.  Both were very good. We found the pancakes to be a little light in flavor. But when I ate them with my main dish, it made a nice balance. 

I had the Cumin Lamb.  Very tasty with a nice spice.  Was very rich in flavor which filled me very quickly.  Again, the pancakes when nicely with this dish.  

Girlfriend had the Stir-Fry Pork Neck Bones.  A large plate of falling off the bone pork bones.  This dish really needed some vegetables to balance the heavy flavor and fill of the pork bones.  You do have to work to get the meat off the bone a little. Small bones with small meat, but it was worth the taste. 

I was most impressed with the Handmade Appetizer menu.  There were many things that I want to try from this list. I could probably make a meal just from this part of the menu.  I would also like to try the different soups. 

Overall, this is a very good Chinese restaurant. Although they do offer the more typical selections, try something a little different!!",4,2013-06-17 17:53

I just had my second take out lunch from NR yesterday, a huge order of Pho (P7 with broccoli and bok choy, $1 extra for tofu) that I wasn't even able to finish. 

When you order take out the Pho comes in a styrofoam cup, the sprouts, jalapeno, basil, siracha and lime are in a baggy, and the noodles and tofu are in the takeout box. I had to separate about half of the broth out of the cup because it was filled to the brim and there was no room for the other goodies. Then I went to work adding all my treats and created a massive pho that was just spicy enough with the little cup of siracha. No I will say that the siracha has some brown sauce mixed in, like soy sauce or something with high sugar (fish sauce?). I wasn't wild about the sweetness that lingered because of that. 

What more can I say? It filled and warmed my belly, burned my esophagus and staved off my 'i haven't eaten lately' crankiness.",4,2009-12-03 18:20

I went for happy hour with some girlfriends and ended up staying well past! The decor is hip and fresh and I just love the old school 80s/90s throwback feel in everything from the wall art to the music (explicit lyrics after 9pm!). I especially loved the TLC mural on the wall- fun fact: Crazy Sexy Cool was the first album I ever purchased! Joe's was formerly a liquor store for many years and the owners want to play homage to it by offering 40 OZ bottles of Bud Light and King Cobra which I think is great. On to the rest of the evening- the whiskey sour shandy was recommended to me and it was to die for! Not too sweet or sour, but perfectly tart and delicious; pretty dangerous if consumed in high quantities I might add! ;) My dining companion ordered the French 75 which was great as well, I'm so happy I have friends that share their liquor with me! For food we got the grilled pulpo- and oh my god it was so delicious! Perfectly seasoned and not too chewy, I seriously could have eaten ten more orders it was that good. We also got to try the bone marrow and it was one of the most flavorful things I've had in a while! Of course I followed it with the infamous marrow luge. For those who don't know the tradition, the marrow luge involves taking a shot of bourbon and using the inside of the bone as a luge to drink the shot. The combination of flavors from the oil, fat, and alcohol makes for one incredible experience! And it's a good conversation starter! On top of the food and drink, the service was also excellent, not like the ""hipster service"" I have come to expect in the area.

My mom was here from out of state and I wanted to take her to this place as past experiences were exceptional.

I ordered a morning monte w/hashbrowns, my mom ordered French toast w/a side of bacon. The morning monte was very good, the hashbrowns were horrid; swimming in what seemed like old oil, old potatoes...I couldn't eat them and sent them back asking for another order... same thing. I think maybe leftover from the weekend?? My moms French toast was doused in butter, which she removed and her bacon had been deep fried! It had no taste whatsoever, she felt hers was leftovers from the weekend as well. To top it off, the place next door, The Perch or something like that, had decided half way through our meal, to have a  landscaper start pulling out trees, whacking bushes and adding drip lines or something RIGHT NEXT TO OUR TABLE!!

An educational tragicomedy by Jetta

(An office setting. Phones are ringing. Nobody seems to notice.)

JETTA
So, since I'm running out and getting lunch, I say we do Chino Bandido.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Chino Bandido, what's that?

JETTA
It's this Chinese/Mexican fusion place on 19th and Greenway.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Chinese and Mexican? What, like they put sweet and sour chicken in a burrito?

JETTA
Well, their menu's a little more diverse than that, but sure, that example is sufficient.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
That sounds fucking disgusting! Putting Chinese food with Mexican food, that's just weird, man! 

JETTA
Well, I like it. So it's either that or you get your own lunch.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
You're serious though, you can get like Chinese food in a tortilla?

JETTA
Alright, so here's how it breaks down. They have 14 different ""entree"" selections. You can get them in a burrito form or a quesadilla form. If you get a combination, you can two entrees with some fried rice and beans, though I just opt for a double order of fried rice because I can't stand beans (it's a texture thing, it's why I won't eat mushrooms).

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Um, okay. Can you get me two bean burritos?

JETTA
No.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
What, they don't have bean burritos?

JETTA
No, they do. But I'm not getting you anything from there if that's all you're going to get.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Why not?

JETTA
Because you're an adult. You might as well go to Red Lobster and order the chicken fingers. If you're not going to order off the menu like a grown up, I'm not getting you lunch. Besides, you can get bean burritos at the cafeteria for cheaper.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Okay, at least tell me this...do they have Chinese people working behind the counter?

JETTA
I'm not sure. I didn't ask any of them for their passport. But they do make a mean jade red chicken. That's Chinese enough for me. What do you care, anyway? You eat at Olive Garden all the time.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
That's because I'm Italian.

JETTA
Yeah but the people who make the food there aren't.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Good point.

JETTA
Look, are you going to get something or not?

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
I don't know what to get.

JETTA
Here, we keep some of their menu forms here. Fill it out. Hurry. I'm hungry and full of artificially occurring hormones.

10 MINUTES LATER...

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Um...I think I filled it out.

JETTA
Let me see...no, you most certainly did not fill this out. You just put a bunch of checkmarks next to things. Fuck it. I'm ordering for you. Hope you like what I get you.

1 HOUR LATER....

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Hey, is this quesadilla supposed to have cheese in it?

JETTA
If there's cheese in it, I think it's safe to say it belongs there.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Oh. That's cool. I mean, it's good. It's really good. I just, you know, not used to having cheese with...uh...what's in this quesadilla anyway?

JETTA
BBQ Pork, I think. The burrito is Pollo Diablo. 

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
What's that?

JETTA
You took four years of Spanish. You tell me.

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Okay...well, anyway, it's good. I mean, it's different, but I like it, I guess. 

TWO DAYS LATER...

RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH
Jetta, you wanna make a Chino Bandido run?

JETTA
Dude, I just clocked in like ten minutes ago.

The first time I drove from Tempe to Phoenix to pick up a Vegan pizza for carry out. 

The pizza was delicious and tasted great the next day, absolutely loved it!

My buddy had told me they had awesome sandwiches as well.  So today I decided to bring two friends and make the trip to eat there, it unfortunately was not the same experience..

I ordered the Veggieball's rolled in buffalo sauce as an appetizer, came out quick and tasted very good! 

Based off this I decided to get the Veggieball Parmegeano Sub with fries. 

When the food comes out she puts it down and I wait for it to cool off only to notice this was the wrong Sandwich, I had gotten the ""veggie baked sub"" by mistake, when I lifted up the sub, the marinara was so watery that it caused the bread to turn to mush and instantly the Sandwich fell apart..

At this point I had to get up to FIND our waitress and let her know I got the wrong order. She offers to get me my correct order witch ended up taking quite a while.

By the time my correct order came both of my friends were done with their food. The sandwich itself was forgettable. Pretty much almost no marinara, and the veggie balls were way over fried and crunchy. 

After it was over I had to once again GET UP to find our waitress (twice nand get a box and our check.

And when we get the bill I notice nothing was comped. No discount or appetizer taken off for the inconvenience.. Nothing done to make it right. Full charged for everything.

Had oh my god roll nothing fascinating other than the fire initiative. The shashmi were really fresh. All the sushi were rolled with purple rice. Not sure how they get the purple color on it but better than the usual white sticking rice. 

The hot sake was not the best that I had here but the sushiolic place had a better hot sake though the y used the same sho Shiku bai sake.  Might repeat later but not anytime soon.

The guy that greeted us at the front was very friendly & took us to a table. The waitress was just as great, however the food was not great. We ordered our drinks first, my companion an iced tea & me a hot tea. I was given a tea bag & a cup of hot water. The water was not hot enough. It's just marginally warm enough as hot tea. Then I ordered the 'bowl of pasta' with 2 meatballs. I wanted spaghetti but they only serve angel hair & fettuccine noodles. When the food came, the noodles were ok, but there was not much tomatoes sauce on the noodles. The meatballs looked like they just came  out of the microwave oven & just lukewarm. They are not even browned. I had to ask the waitress to reheat them. My question is: how come they don't serve spaghetti (for the 'Bowl of Pasta' )? Spaghetti should be very common in Italian restaurants. Also the sauce is pretty spicy. Maybe they want to do a little differently  from the traditional Italian restaurants, but maybe we could have the option of 'not spicy' in the tomato sauce. Next time I'll stick with other traditional Italian restaurants !",2,2017-12-14 16:50

The food quality has been excellent. Personally, I go for their fried rice and their soups, but everything on the menu is pretty damn good, as far as I can tell.

Prices were decent, and the staff were pretty attentive with refills and such. Then again, I always try to come on the off hours. If you make a reservation in advance, it works wonders!

Second, we had the foie gras. This is the best Foie Gras I have tasted so far. The serving was only 1oz, but worth every succulent bite. I was not a fan of the sauce they added on the side. I like the Foie Gras flavors to shine through.

The downsides? If we didn't have the Groupon, it would be a bit costly for the amount of pizza you get. Also, because they're wood-fired, it doesn't seem like the crust can hold too many toppings.

The real question is, is it worth standing in line for? NO! and differently not in the summer.
Not to say I wouldn't eat the food. I'd just rather go someplace else (there are many), where the food is just as good if not better, with faster service. Waiting inside and better prices. Their price for a rack of ribs is so much, I felt I was paying for someones Porsche or their kids education.

Sometimes I have them make a quesadilla out of my choices, but usually I just like them unadorned with the rice and beans.  I can't decide which I love more, the black or regular refried beans.  One time I ordered the chile relleno and it was heavenly fried goodness.

Another time, I was stuck on what to serve my book club so I ordered a bunch of food from here and everyone raved about it.  I sent home doggie bags.

But then I learned from a friend in the know that what you actually need to do if you want sushi is to order their $5 special rolls. Way cheaper, and still a good selection!

The restaurant smelled intoxicating. If that wasn't enough the decor wooed me in the rest of the way. We were seated promptly and given menus to review. 

One of my favorite things off the bat was that our waitress Naomi didn't ask us what we wanted to drink, she asked if we wanted anything aside from water. I liked knowing that either way, I was getting something while I made a decision on dinner. 

And, well, that was a pretty hard decision. The menu has countless items I am still craving now after reading them hours before. I ended up having the red salmon curry, which was accompanied by sticky rice and steamed zucchini, broccoli, sprouts, carrots, mushrooms, and bamboo shoots. It was so phenomenal that half of me was sad I was unable to finish it all but the other half was excited my taste buds would get to experience it for lunch tomorrow. 

The service was truly top notch and everything was prompt and genuine. From our server to the owner, I can do nothing but compliment them repeatedly. That alone makes me anxious to return. You don't see this level of service much these days.

The plastic tables and chairs did not help.  If you are new to Chino Bandido, they have you try several samples of their food, which was a nice touch on a so far lack-luster impression.  I decided on the Jade Red Chicken.  I was served my order but I wanted to wait for my husband to be served his before digging in.  We waited about 15 minutes and his order never came out so he went up to the counter to ask about it.  Apparently they forgot to put his order in.  By the time his order came out, mine was cold.  I took a bite from my chicken, and was confused so I inspected the piece further.  It was dark and did not taste like chicken. I tried a few more pieces and discovered the same thing.  I brought my order up to the counter and had the staff verify that it was chicken.  I'm still not convinced it was chicken.  To make the experience worse, I noticed one of the workers taking a few bites from a customer's order before bringing it out to them.  They were still chewing the food when they served the customer. Gross!",1,2012-10-29 1:05

 We enjoyed the chip appetizer and boy it was lovely to enjoy especially with the unique sauces offered.
 I ordered the Caesar salad with shrimp add on and used about half the dressing along with some of the other sauces for a scrumptious meal! BE SURE to note the check in offer of taco and beer!
 Oh and the Mexican mule was really something, the margarita was good as well but must be enjoyed slowly to avoid brain freeze",5,2016-09-15 1:04

Where do I begin.... first it was very unorganized, everyone was running around. People standing waiting in the front with no one greeting. I stood there at first and was confused if someone was going to take our name down. There was an older couple that had already been waiting prior to us arriving who left. My husband asked me if i just wanted to go somewhere else. I said no I want to try this place. So we ended up sitting at the bar. Our waitress was very nice. We ordered Chicken Karaage, Nishikawa Black, and the Spicy Miso. The broth literately tasted like powder and was so thick and I just cant even describe it. It was starting to turn into gelatin . My Pork on the top of my Spicy Miso was nothing but a big piece of fat I couldn't even eat it. The noodles where hard and could have been boiled a lot longer. The appetizer was probably the only good think oh and the house Green Tea. I also thought that it was really unusual that they were putting dirty dishes on the back bar where they put the food that was ready to go to a customer. I don't think I will be returning. My cup of ramen the next day was better....",1,2016-07-13 2:33

They use milk in the refried beans instead of oil.

The one at North is very trippy it has glowing magenta mushrooms on the walls. Very acidy, weird.

I liked the cream cheese burrito thing but I got it not deep fried. 

Pretty good a bit pricey but the portions are huge so share.

It truley is family owned my brother is friends with the owners son. I think 2 or three families own it.

The restaurant is filled with lit candles everywhere both inside and outside - If you can, try to sit outside in their courtyard. It is a oasis of ivy, candles, and stars right above that inspires the imagery of the secret garden. They have heaters almost at at 1:2 table ratio so it's easy to stay warm despite the winter season. 

The food is incredible. It is priced at $65/person for a 4 course meal + $30/person for wine tasting. The menu changes week to week but during my visit, I had sweet potato bisque, a fresh winter salad, filet mignon, and a rum cake. I was pleased with the wine pairings - the sommelier was clearly gifted in his trade and did a great job in enhancing the already perfect meal. 

The service (our waiter: Bradley) is attentive but not overbearing - there wasn't a point during the meal that I needed to wave someone over. We had to wait a few minutes for our table, but the beautiful patio and cocktail menu made the time go by quickly. The owner was lovely and checked on us regularly. She apologized for the wait and made sure we had the best table in the courtyard.

I've been here a few times and have loved it ever since the first day. There are so many great things about this place. I love the atmosphere and the way the place is set up. When you walk in you can grab a table or sit by the cozy little fireplace that they have. I love their outdoor patio. It's big and they have two fire pits outside to sit by. Another plus is they also have live music there every night I believe. 

As far as the food and drinks. I love me some Pinot Noir so I always order the Ramsay which is delicious. For food I've tried a majority of their bruschetta which is really good and have also had their Italian flatbread. They also have a happy hour everyday from 3-6  which I haven't been able to take advantage of yet. Their staff is also really great. Everyone is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and they really take care of you.

When they get super busy it can be a little slower but nothing major and frankly no restaurant is perfect.  Since the other places have opened in the strip mall the whole area has really picked up, which is nice to see.  The Cali Benedict, shrimp and chorizo hash, and the Florentine are excellent.  The eggs and sausage with a biscuit are very good.  Love the biscuits!  The coffee drinks are always tasty, love the Americano and Soy Latte.  They also have many coffee drinks that aren't on the menu so ask or tell them what you want.  For lunch, the goat burger is really good.

First the good: Location, location, location. Right in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale by Fashion Square and the Canal. The restaurant looks the part, has an amazing patio covered by massive shade trees alongside the canal. There are cleverly hidden scent sprayers in the event the canal or the many birds in the neighborhood emanate a less desirable scent. 

Service is fairly good. Young, good looking people are cast to fulfill the part of waiters and most play their part well. Our waitress for lunch yesterday was super, the one we had a few weeks go would have rather been elsewhere and we left early. 

Now the mediocre: I would call it the food. If you have been to one Fox Restaurant Concept eatery you've been to all. In a sense it brings a certain level of comfort knowing that you'll have similar food in the different restaurants of the company; I wish however that each restaurant did a better job differentiating itself by offering more varied food choices.

And last but not least, the bad: The restaurant, and all of the company's restaurants really, are build for turning tables in their dining rooms. It is virtually impossible to have a conversation because it is so loud inside. The patio is more forgiving. 

Basically, Olive and Ivy looks the part, has decent service with run of the mill food. If you want to see an be seen in this neighborhood its the place to be.",3,2015-12-29 17:46

I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen (what I use as my baseline order for a new ramen place), and it was definitely yummy, but had a very...Chinese taste? Being Chinese, I have no qualms with a Chinese tasting noodle soup, but I was just slightly taken aback by this realization.  

*Tonkotsu - Broth wasn't watery, chashu was well seasoned, noodles were thin (as I prefer) - a little long though (I had trouble maneuvering the right amount of noodle into my spoon because they just never separated), toppings (wood ear fungus mostly) were reasonably rationed. My biggest issue though was the EGG!!! How did I not look closer at the menu?! I ended up with a hard boiled egg, and was pretty disappointed, since the soft boiled egg is one of my major critique points with ramen.
*Shio - I only took a sip of the broth, but I think I like the Tonkotsu a little more, personally. Still, it was well seasoned and very corny
*Chashu don - umm...super Chinese? I couldn't pinpoint what exactly it tasted like, but it reminded me a lot of Chinese style pork sauces.

Not yet atleast.  It's my husband who regularly visits this establishment on his lunch hour...and subsequently has RAVED about the place!

A couple months back he brought home some salsa and tortilla's for our Saturday morning breakfast burritos. I was amazed at how HUGE the tortilla's are so I only had half--which he was thrilled about since it left more for him.  They have great flavor and texture to them. I can see why they've been voted the BEST of the best! 

Then there's the salsa. Oh the salsa. I plan my weekly meals in such a way as to incorporate this salsa so I can enjoy it as often as possible. Essentially that meant paying $6.00 for a quart of it. But seriously, this stuff is like ""liquid gold' to me--I'd (almost) pay any price for it...because it's THAT amazing! 

The flavor is smooth (at first) then smokey, sweet with a punch of heat and the end. I can't get enough of the stuff! It's spicy enough to make your nose run (if you eat enough of it) and hot enough to keep your metabolism up for hours! 

I can't wait to go try their FOOD and see how it holds up to the amazing reputation of their salsa and tortillas. Surely I won't be dissapointed!",5,2012-03-28 19:44

Harumi Sushi is one of the newer treasures I've come to find in downtown Phoenix. The owner, ""Sexy Juno"", and his team serve up some of the best sushi I've had in Phoenix thus far.

I personally prefer the Crazy Roll and Sex and the City Roll - but honestly, I can't imagine that anything they serve that you might be eyeing would steer you wrong. And the purple rice..... not sure what it is that makes it so yum-o but it is super delicious.

I also LOVE that this place serves the real-deal-nasal-passage-clearing wasabi on their sushi pieces. If you haven't had the privilege of having the good stuff - and just that pasty green goop they serve at most other places, give it a whirl.... But it's not for the faint at heart (Harumi does have the other stuff too, just in case you're a wimp). Of course, a sake bomb or two could easily solve this problem for you.

The only gripe I have is I wish it was open later. Granted, nothing downtown is really open late enough when it comes to food, so it's not a big issue. But sometimes it would be nice to be able to pop in for a late night fix. I've seen they have some quick grab-n-go options throughout the day. So if you want a late night bite it might be worth grabbing one and popping it in the fridge at home for later.

Today, though, I paid for my scone and macchiato since I'd left the coupon at home. Totally worth it. The espresso is up there with Giant. And the dark chocolate and cherry scone was appropriately sized, not a big box bakery Goliath. Perhaps too much raw sugar on top. I brushed a bit off. 

The space offers a better feel than Coronado Cafe and Urban Vine (terrible name) did. Decor is Lux meets Cartel,  and the wood floor homifies it warmly. 

Though no demitasse cups yet, the super-friendly and accommodating barista offered me the macchiato in a tiny glass jar. Worked for me. 

$2 off signature cocktails during happy hour. A very intriguing lunch and dinner menu with nearly all entries vegan. Can't wait to go for weekend breakfast. 

Welcome to the neighborhood. 

UPDATE: Finally had lunch here. Just awesome. The server brought us some gratis potato tacos. Savory and delicious, but the double corn tortilla likely unnecessary. One will do. 

I had the Monte Vista torta and the standout components were the salty zucchini and buoyant focaccia. A bit pricey at $11 but a solid lunch.

I'd tried to get in to use a coupon I'd purchased for $25 dollars at least 3 times before I actually made it in.

Attempt one: ""We don't accept reservations this late."" (The coupon required a reservation) 
Attempt two: ""We're not open this late on Sundays"" (It was 7pm) 
Attempt three: ""We're not open, doing construction on the patio.""

In each attempt mentioned above, a man answered the phone and seemed to begrudge my attempts to patron his business with a tone in his voice and curtness in his reply.

The final time I attempted to make a reservation a woman answered, she was much more professional and customer-service oriented. (Maybe she should be in charge of answering the phone. Hint. Hint.)

After arriving I was informed that my coupon had expired; $25 wasted.
The owner said he felt bad about it, and gave us a few free drinks. I was livid. However, I felt a little better after the pretentious European wine (very mediocre tasting). The salad was disappointing, the cheese overpowered it. I might have been happier with just a wedge of cheese on a plate.

My cutie pie and hubby were suddenly surprised by the cages of birds along the meandering paths.  The early 1900's cottages are transformed into eclectic shops.  I would never have found this place.  The credit also goes to Miss Monique H.'s review as I scrambled to find a breakfast place for the boys closer to home.  

Hubby ordered the Chorizo Breakfast Burrito ($5.99)  with potatoes.  I told my son that the burrito was almost as big as he was when he was born.  He beamed in ...horrible to think I likened him to a burrito. It wasn't sickeningly huge, but enough to skip lunch and have a light dinner.  It was so fluffly and moist with enough heat to tickle the taste buds.  My cutie pie picked from the KIDS MENU-he decided on the Hawaiian French Bread Sticks ($4.95).  All he wanted was a side of strawberries, which our server happily substituted.  

I had to ask if the Mornin' Monte ($7.79) was similar to the deep fried Monte Christo sandwich-a friend's favorite-my nightmare.  I've never had it, but deep fried battered sandwich scares me.  I've never had a thing for Thai toast either.  They take Hawaiian bread French toasts, turkey slices, havarti, egg whites and bacon to make their Monte.

Our meals came out next and I had the bone in ribeye which was no joke better than any I have have anywhere in the valley. Better than Flemings, Ruth's, Mastros. Cooked perfect. My wife is not a huge steak fan but she is now because of their filet. She ordered it well (unfortunately) but it was still tender and flavorful as can be. Our sides were shoestring potatoes which I would pass on next time. 

With the food being so good we still may not go back due to the top portion of this review. If you love makeshift seating, terrible iced tea, overpriced appetizers but really good steaks and salads check this place out.",3,2015-04-26 18:11

Once you walk in you are definitely welcomed with such enthusiastic smiles and service. Sushi here is very active as when I say active sushi is always made so you definitely know your plate and rolls are going to be fresh indeed! You get a simple paper menu, and they also have to go sushi if you want to do grab and go which is something I can definitely get into. Our waitress and the workers were really interactive and so helpful! Guiding us Thru our menu and definitely the elder lady in the glasses helped us out with her cheerful personality. She pointed out he special which was better than the special roll we were gonna get which was the spicy combo roll or h3 maybe? But definitely get the ""omg"" roll cause it will let you be saying oh my gosh! Such a cool concept and delicious roll you'll just have to try it yourself! All their sushi roll is made with a healthy purple/black rice which is delicious and healthy for you I heard. Definitely don't mind, you pay for what you get and that's excellent sushi! Might be the best one in Phoenix so far! Well you'll certainly see my face there! If your in downtown ; it's a must stop by! Stay hungry Phoenix!",5,2016-07-01 1:23

The hardest part is finding a parking spot, since the downtown area can be quite hard to navigate.  Melt was quite small and overall quite clean.  Unfortunately no public loo for me to try.  And I was ready!!!  The dairy products helped too....Jk

We got a scope of cute-cumber which was very refreshing, even the neighborhood kitty thought so.  And a scope of Cookie Monster which my friends thought was the perfect amount of sweetness and chewiness from the cookie and stuff.  And the blue colour was amazing. 

Overall a great and fantastic little place, and we highly recommend you come here today.  And the cat does too, she's hangry!!",4,2017-10-20 15:11

Ordering is kind of weird you order at the station next to the grill then walk around the corner to pay and then they call out your number.  I think they do this so that you can walk around and see the burgers grilling and the kitchen.  

On the other side of the place there is a full bar.  They also have an outside eating area and back entrance.  

The food is awesome.  I have been here pretty regular since I discovered it on yelp.  The buns have always been fresh and the burgers are grilled so they are not as juicy and greasy.  But thats a good thing.  They have an awesome flavor! The condiment bar is pretty cool.  You get the standard fair.  This is pretty much a build your own burger place.  I like to take my burger and put lettuce tomato onions and thousand island.  Its like an in and out on steroids! 

The fried fair is good. Im not a fan of their french fries I usually go for the half mushroom/zucchini combo.  But if you get a combo with fries I recommend getting a ranch cup from the condiment bar and dipping them in that.  Their ranch is so good!   

The Chicken sandwich is also good.  Get the plain unless you want to be covered in sauce. 

Overall I love this place this is a great family restaurant and you wont break the bank.  Only thing I would knock a star off is for customer service.  About half the time the person behind the counter seems to have an attitude for some reason.

The Owner of WildFlower wrote me a very kind e-mail expressing concern over my bad experience. We had a couple of very kind exchanges and a very pleasant phone call.

I am excited to come back and give Wildflower another go.And no, I am not accepting free food. Louis offered to make a charitable donation to a breast cancer charity in my friend's name instead. 

I am upping this two stars automatically. I'll happily give it another shot. On my own dime. Another review to follow.
*************************************

It's fairly uncommon for me to write a 1 or 2 star review, because I am a generally positive person when it comes to my Yelp finds. 

This morning, I woke up after a fantastic night, and I figured, why not try Wildflower. It seemed to be an Arizona institution and had some great reviews on Yelp. Why not?

I walked in, and everything seemed like it was on par. Clean establishment. Plenty of small booths, with power outlets, free wi-fi, the whole nine-yards.

This morning, I ordered a ""Sausage and Egg Breakfast Sandwich"" which is: ""scrambled eggs, sausage, green onion, roasted red pepper, cheddar and cilantro on a buttered Ciabatta Roll.""

I sat down and waited. And waited. I was starving, but like a true English gentleman, I waited patiently some more. Finally, 14 minutes later, as I was about to get up and say something, my food arrived.

Now, on the menu, the sandwich sounded good, but it just didn't work in the execution phase. The Ciabatta was mushy, and gooey. Rather gross. The eggs were overcooked, and dry, and everything just seemed very....inedible. My fantastic morning quickly turned miserable because of this horrid sandwich.

I don't see myself ever coming back here after this experience, especially since there are so many other breakfast options in the area. I'd much rather drive down the street and brave traffic and parking issues in Old Town and grab something from the Sandwich Club...and get something far superior.",3,2011-09-17 22:10
fMYMFU1jwdbLXDkcQXs2mg,rRfx0TVMZ5NvdBkN8555Tw,r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA,"Third visit to Defalco's recently and still don't see what all the fuss is about. Customer service is very good and prompt but the food is menza menz based on the cheesesteaks, Italian sandwich, and tuna sandwich. Found the cheesesteak to be somewhat salty and bread dry and lacking flavor. The steak meat was top quality with very little gristle and cooked properly but the overall saltiness detracted from the experience. 
The Italian sandwich offered better quality bread but still was lacking the punch of flavors you'd expect from a great sandwich. Very good quality meats nicely assembled but still did not meet expectations based on the reviews. I believe the tuna was a mix of the two grades of tuna and again very bland. I did see a few people eating pasta and should probably try next visit since it did appear to be fresh pasta.
The store itself is fairly well stocked with both frozen and dry goods as well as several selections of jar sauces and various Italian specialties and, of course, a deli. It's nice that they offer a nice selection of bottles of wine and/or beer with your meal or for take out but overall, based on the sandwiches I tried, not the best sandwich shop in the Scottsdale area. 
A special Thank You to the staff member who brought a bowl of water for our dog while we ate outside, that's customer service!",3,2015-07-14 15:40

My second attempt to dine here, as it was so busy the first time (and so noisy!), that I had to leave.  (It was during lunch hours, and I don't like to wait.)  Arrived a few minutes shy of the end of lunch, so I was able to dine in peace.  Ordered the tofu green curry and the fried banana and coconut ice cream for dessert.  I found the portion of the entree to be very skimpy for the price, and I've had much tastier, and creamier, curry sauce elsewhere (Tottie's, Thai Elephant, even Yupha's!).  Need I say more?  Seriously, WT's green curry tastes about the same as Thai Hut's, but at a portion that's about half (or less) of what I could get at TH, or any of the other places I've visited, but I suppose the ""atmosphere"" is what I'm paying for here?  That said, I must admit that the fried banana dessert was delicious!  Loved the toasted coconut on top (well, on top of the bananas, but under the syrup toppings, coconut ice cream, whipped topping, and maraschino cherry!).  On my next visit, when I'm craving for something sweet, I will ask to have the syrup toppings, whipped cream, and cherry omitted.  The dish is perfect w/out them.",2,2010-04-23 8:54

It seemed like a good way to reward ourselves for the hard work.  As I prepared to return for a quick valentimes whistle stop return, my one request was to sit outside again in the warmth of the desert and drink a beer at Oreganos.

I didn't quite get my wish, as we decided on dinner rather than lunch, and at that point it was even too cold to sit outside for this Michigander.  But all that melted away as we ordered the Picasso.  A finer, tastier deep dish pizza you will never have.  Not Chicago, not anywhere. Yes it takes 45 minutes, but we were surrounded with fantastic company and drinking delicious beers, so the wait flew by.

This place was packed on a Saturday morning, so I could tell it was a hit haha. There weren't even any tables open, we thought we were going to have to get food to go and sit at the restaurant next door! Luckily a table opened up and we snagged it right away. There was also a bit of a line but it seemed to move pretty quickly.
It was smaller in there than I had expected but it was cool! It had a coffee house-type vibe which I liked! Was very clean too. I was excited to check in on yelp to get a free tea! I decided on a loose leaf earl grey. It wasn't my fave tea, but it was free so I can't complain.
There were two savory vegetarian crepe options. I thought the horseradish on the buckwheat one would be too much for me so I went for the 13mi Vegetable crepe. I also spilt a first time for dessert, which is Nutella and banana! Presentation for both was A+, very fancy, I loved it! One downside is that portions are small though. Would be a good place to come for a light meal, but I wouldn't recommend if you are wanting a good hearty meal, unless you're down to be spending a lot. Something that I liked about the vegetable crepe was the variety of vegetables in it, lots of my favorites too and they all tasted fresh. I also enjoyed the difficult to eat parmesan crisp on top. I appreciate that they use lots of local stuff there too! The crepe was a tad spicier than expected and I wasn't super into the spices used in it and stuff, but it wasn't bad! I did like it overall. The first time was delicious, very simple and tasty. I especially liked the banana on top.

We arrived at 9:30 a.m. before any rush, which is ALWAYS a huge plus. I felt lucky. The ladies at the counter were perky for a Sunday morning, which is more than I could say for myself...COFFEE PLEASE! 

After deliberating with my friend about which two dishes to choose out of the dozens that sounded fantastic, I ordered The Pear-- complete with bosc pear, havarti cheese, sliced almonds and bacon. My friend ordered the huevos and chorizo! These meals were tres bien and aye aye aye awesome, respectively. The Pear had crispy bacon served up in the cheesy goodness, which was balanced out by the crisp pears and almonds. I enjoyed the array of tastes present. I topped mine off with a Bloody Mary, which was served in a tall glass with just the right amount of spice. Hurray!  The huevos and chorizo was the right amount of mess. The combination of chorizo, onions, grilled potatoes, salsa, cheese with flour tortilla can never steer me wrong after any night, especially a long one. Our waters were consistently refilled for us by wandering good-looking waiters. The aesthetics and atmosphere looked and felt good to me. There is also the right amount of people-watching one can do here, from the hungover sorority types, to the bicycling hipsters, and cheery family members and friends greeting one another. I was entertained.

However, the queue steadily grew towards the door while we enjoyed our conversation and brekkie. So, while I love it, I will never go there during the rush hours. I totally understand some of the frustration about wait times. SO! That said, overall experience was fantastic and I'll get my slow butt up early for breakfast again and again! :)",4,2011-09-14 16:11

After a quick visit to their beloved jobot's next door we had to hit this place up especially since it was a friggen hot August day! Such a cute place with great selections of ice cream. They make their ice cream from scratch! That's what I'm talking about! I had the strawberry cilantro which was a seasonal one, and it was very quenching and delicious for the hot summer day, kind of reminded me of a Mexican paleta. My husband got the banana and he loved it, there were some chunks in it too! They serve the ice cream in Chinese take out boxes or cones. Did I mention that they're open until midnight?! AWESOME! We will be back for sure!!",5,2013-12-03 22:49
CnwIZo7PIoA_mPTW3FLuWQ,VFJwV-4OxcxtTM7MEg7P3g,r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA,"Wow.

Defalco's brings Italian food to a whole new level! Do not be deceived by their name, it is a grocery store but they have a restaurant tucked away in there as well and you do not want to miss out. Hidden behind the aisles of delicious shelf stable Italian food, as well as fresh you will find a deli, as well as a counter where you can order pizza's, pastas, calzones, sandwiches, salads, desserts, oh and the best philly cheese steak sandwich (don't question this just get it!) 

You will probably have a hard time anytime of the day or week finding seating in here, it is a really small place, but if you have the patience it is not impossible to get a seat, and you do seat yourself. So if you come with someone and you notice an open table immediately send someone to sit there even if they haven't ordered yet, because chances are that when you're done ordering it will be gone.

You can also purchase wine here by the glass or the bottle, if you want some you might as well buy a bottle because the glass will run you about $7 dollar and you can find some decent ones on their shelf for around $15. Just ask for some wine glasses and for the bottle to be opened. No corkage fee either.

I would choose a meal here over a fancy Italian restaurant any day. The calzones blow my mind even their simple cheese calzone is amazing. They come with marinara on the side, not inside of it. This prevents it from getting soggy. The dough is light, crisp and perfect. 

The pastrami sandwich is the best I have ever had. The Philly cheese steak sandwich is also the best I have ever had. It makes it so hard to choose!

They also have these little marzipan cookie/cakes that are so delicious for only about $1. Along with a wide array of other desserts like cannolis.

So if you are in the mood for Italian head to Defalco's everytime.",5,2017-12-25 6:40

Ok enough of them, everyone talks about them, now onto other things I tried.
The artichoke hummus with olives & tomatoes and flatbread, yes that was good, was it memorable, no, it was ok.

Also tried the chicken liver pate with pickled onions toast, my friend ordered these because she wanted to try it, I was game, my 1st bite was great, the red pickled onions and the pate mixed together was a perfect blend, but the 2nd bite, that's where it turned way too salty for me to enjoy. 

Now the local ricotta & roasted peppers toast was so delish! It was toasted perfectly, the ricotta & peppers with balsamic vinegar was omg cosmic, was very very sad when it had disappeared!

#NAME?,rqv9mIc9pj9R_b0MIm_fzg,Xg5qEQiB-7L6kGJ5F4K3bQ,"I fell in love with Central TX Style BBQ at Franklin's in Austin.  I don't like BBQ where it's drenched in a whole mess of sauce.  Sauce on the side yes that's A-OK!  If you have to pick a sauce.  My fave of their three is the tangy-spicy.  

And when it comes to TX the star of the show is the brisket.  Fatty or lean chopped up or sliced.....Little Miss BBQ delivers.  Personally if your only going to be here once go with the fatty brisket and the pork ribs.  Just melt in your mouth goodness and the smoke from the pecan and pistachio wood come through in every bite.  

Owners Scott and Bekke are constantly checking in on customers while waiting in line and dining and some of the friendliest people you could ever meet.  

The only side I personally recommend is the ranch style beans that had chunks of their home made jalapeño sausage but the cheddar grits although was good but perhaps not the ideal side to pair with BBQ.  The coleslaw and potato salad I would pass next time.  Nothing to write about.  On this particular day we were able to also get the Pumpkin Nutella pie and Bekke's Smoked Pecan Pie both ""baked"" in their smoker.  The pecan pie was a bit too syrupy to my liking.  I personally would pass on that next time.  But the pumpkin pie with drizzle of Nutella baked in is a nice touch.  I would get that again but it's not available everyday .  

Arrived here 40 minutes before they opened at 11AM on a Tuesday morning.  2 parking spots left when we arrived.  I've heard it's a zoo on Saturdays.  Glad I was able to stop by during the week!  

What to look forward to on certain days weekly.......

Smoked Lamb on Wednesdays.

Smoked Pastrami on Thursdays.  

Pork AND Beef ribs on Fridays and Saturdays.

Overall I'm giving LMB 4 stars.  5 stars for the brisket and pork ribs.  The sides and their pies get 3 stars overall.  At the end of the day it's the protein!  This is a must stop if your a carnivore in Phoenix.  Perhaps it should be your first stop if you just arrived at Sky Harbor from a morning flight cause it's right there!

I usually get the half jalapeno/half roasted red bell pepper hummus followed by the glazed chicken lavosh. The lavosh is absolutely amazing, toasted in their wood fire oven and topped with generous portions of the honey glazed chicken and feta cheese. The half green tea/half lemonade arnold palmer is my refreshment of chioce, refreshing my taste buds and preparing them for another round of the excellent food. 

The servers here are great too, but I don't mean in a white-glove waiter sort of way. These are the people that are fresh off the bong, and honestly, I'm surprised the food even makes it to the table intact. Don't get me wrong, If they were to change this I may not frequent as much. I enjoy my fare share of baked-out-of-their-mind servers, there's just less stress!  

The only negative thing I can think of about this place is that the dishes are a little too expensive to make it a weekly stop and the tables are pretty crowded together. Other than that I've never seen anything to complain about.

This is my second time to try this place and while I really like the atmosphere I have to say the food is slightly better than ok.  I went with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday dinner and our waiter was great!  We had awesome conversation, great ambience and certainly the food is good; its just nothing to rave about.  I personally ordered the tuna sandwich because that is what I had the first time I went here and it was THE best tuna sandwich ever.  The first time it was chopped up ahi tuna and then pressed together like a hamburger patty with other ingredients.  It was served rare like sushi and was one of the most delicious tastes you could imagine.  This time I ordered it again, thinking I was going to get the same thing but when it came out it was SLICED ahi tuna on a bun.  Still good, but not NEARLY as unconventional or tasty as the first one.  When I asked the waiter about it, he said the chef decided to change it (no doubt the preparation for the previous way was way too entailed than just slicing up some tuna and placing it between two buns).  

The sandwich is $14 and comes with French fries or you can substitute a side salad for $1.00 more which I did.  Another friend ordered the hamburger (bunless) and got the side salad too.  It is served with a lemon aioli dressing already on it but we had to ask for more because it was almost tasteless.  Several other in our group ordered the pork chop and it was nicely prepared (except for one) and another person ordered the lamb chop.  Overall the place is fine for a casual dining experience if you don't have high expectations.  Considering all of the options available in the 7th St. corridor now, this place should be trying to do everything it can to keep its customers coming back.

yw3FjSnGTe1hZe5OmSuojA,79uQM6mAgJJcmYRtMO_u1Q,VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg,"Imagine if you were Pakastani and you wanted to open a restaurant that would cater to the mainstream. You would make it trendy inside. You would offer a nice bar. You would hire American people as your servers. And you would make the food not so spicy. In essence, you would create the PF Chang's of Indian Food. You would give it an Indian sounding name like Tandoori TImes and remove any vestiges of Pakistan as Indian restaurants are better recognized and thus seen as a safer option among the mainstream.  Well, that's exactly what Tandoor Times is. 

Being Indian, I prefer Indian food meaning I like all the grilled meat items but they better be able to make quality sabjis and vegetarian dishes too.  Tandoori Times is a Pakastani restaurant; it's not an Indian restaurant. It's almost the same but their dishes are different. Pakastani cuisine involves Tandoori items and grilled items. Their cooking style is less spicy and offers less cream in their dishes.  Indian (Punjani/North Indian) food involves Tandoor items as well in addition to vegetable dishes, more variety and types of curries and is spicier and more flavorful in general. If you are a non-vegetarian like myself, you can survive on the curries and the shish kebob and other meat items. However, when you taste their chaat, deserts and vegetarian sabjis, this restaurant clearly does not know what they are doing.  If you are vegetarian of Indian descent, you will be sorely disappointed.  Nothing against Pakastani cuisine but vegetarian dishes are not your forte much like curries and grilled options are not really a part of South Indian cooking.  

The food is on the mild side. Of course, if you ask them to make something hotter, they can but their food in general is not very spicy and is bland with the exception of some of their curries.  If you are a Non-Indian and you want to try Indian food for the first time, this would be a good place to start. If you are someone who has eaten quality Indian food and wants the real thing, avoid this place because this is as far from being the real thing as possible. 

The service and ambience was quite nice. I think that's the real draw of this restaurant since most Indian restaurants have poor service and often a dirty or claustrophobic environment.  This is a trendy restaurant in old town Scottsdale that you could take a date to.  The service was good when we went there but at the same time the servers were pretty ignorant of the menu and didn't know a lot about Indian food.

Being Indian, this place was just a bunch of hype.  Yes, it was neat to see friendly American people serving Indian food since I'm used to Indian waiters who are abrupt and to the point.  I liked the ambience but the food was disappointing. Their palak paneer honestly tasted as if some non-Indian person decided to try and make it from a cookbook at home. It was not spicy nor was it cooked properly. Their malai kofta was not even malai kofta....let's put it that way.  I will say this, their Tandoori chicke was probably the best I've had in the valley and that's not suprising since Pakastani cooking involves meat and they know how to grill meat well but outside of their meat dishes, it was completely lackluster. 

The bottom line is that if you are an Indian person or a person who is used to eating quality Indian food and you want honest to goodness quality INDIAN (not Pakastani) food, avoid this place.  If you are a non-Indian person wanting to check out Indian/Pakastani food and just want to have a good time, this place is for you.  Note, however that the prices are rather high for an Indian/Pakastani restaurant so you are paying for that ambience.",3,2008-10-14 0:08

Because of health issues, companion was not able to drink any of the drinks on the menu, and the owner kindly allowed a drink to be brought in from the outside that was acceptable.

We had a minor communication problem in that we ordered soup dumplings and received a bowl of broth with dumplings swimming in it. After working out our communication, we were brought the real Shanghai soup dumplings and were told to also keep the regular dumplings at no charge.
It must be said that the regular dumplings were wonderful and the broth they were in was beautifully clear and flavorful. As for the Shanghai soup dumplings, they were just as flavorful and totally delicious. Companion also ordered spring rolls which were nice and crispy, had good flavor, and were accompanied by a nice dipping sauce.

Companion ordered the Honey Shrimp which is a standard dish in many chinese restaurants, but this was a bit different. First of all, the food was cooked perfectly and second of all, if was not the cloyingly sweet item that most places serve. The sweetness was reserved allowing for truly tasting the shrimp and the broccoli

For myself, I ordered Szechuan style Ma Po Tofu, another dish which is available in almost any Chinese restaurant. Normally it is made with tsin tsin peppers, but here was a new twist on an old dish. Heat was supplied by jalapeno peppers, and to my great surprise by real Szechuan pepper corns. For those who have not had the experience of these wonderful pepper corns, they leave your tongue and mouth a bit numb after eating them, which is a true mark of real Szechuan food. 
In the U.S. most places making this dish use ground up pork, but here they use actual chunks of meltingly tender meat. This was an altogether satisfying dish.

Portions were all large and prices were quite reasonable.

4 stars for excellent food, good portion size, and being very accommodating to the customers needs.",4,2015-06-29 18:56
wo40nySx6z-QRxD7Vk5YTQ,Bze8ZkwBTNFGiTOv6ExaeA,wUKzaS1MHg94RGM6z8u9mw,"So, I had a work lunch here earlier this week (this being a Tuesday, I guess it was yesterday!) and was a bit unimpressed.  Obviously, a great location and you can't beat a seat on the patio for happy hour, but it just wasn't great (and I'm a big Sam Fox fan!).

First, our waitress was a bit off - just off on timing, her explanations, a whole host of things, but she did do a good job keeping up with the pony keg of iced tea we all drank! The food was ehhh...decent. We started with the calamari (which I don't love so nothing held against O&I on that one... although the fried zucch's were a nice addition) and then I had the chopped chicken salad. It was good, but nothing to really get excited about and it had a strange peanut-brittle topping that seemed to be kind of out of place. 

As for the rest of the guests, one sent his ravioli's back and got the same salad I had as he said the rav's were not good. The others (french dip sandwich, gnocchi and a flatbread) were all a bit underwhelmed. 

I have been here many times before and have found it to be pretty inconsistent. I definitely prefer dinner to lunch , especially based on this last experience and again, it's pretty solid for happy hour especially with the awesome people watching...the weekly Cougar convention!

I have eaten and loved the Banana's Foster French Toast, the Loaded Omelette and the Turkey Pesto on Focaccia. Yum Yum Yum. Oh I almost forgot I had the Blueberry Blast Smoothie and it was delicious- pretty much everything is good! They are also right next to the light rail. I like that A LOT! But beware, it's always busy, so it might not be a good place if you literally only have minutes. Another plus, is the patio is dog friendly. The patio is my favorite place to sit because of the great people watching opportunities on Mill Ave, but I wish it was a little bigger.",4,2012-10-28 20:41

Disappointing. Service was more production oriented - more like a breakfast factory than a place to relax and enjoy. Servers were more involved with entertaining each other than ensuring guests were enjoying their meal. 

Granted, we came in late (1:30ish) and staff was intent on sweeping the floors, clanging silverware for roll ups, just not consumer friendly. The food was good/ok, but nothing special. 

Some of the server uniforms were disgusting filthy - AND obviously not from one or 2 shifts. Atmosphere is about as basic as a government cafeteria...

Definitely recommend the masala dosa, which is slightly cooler than most of the other spicy food and is good to have around to temper your mouth-fire.  We also had the samosa chaat, lamb vindaloo (FIRE!!!), chicken biryani hyderabadi, and chaat masala.  Make sure you order naan - you'll need it to sop up the awesome curry sauces and to put on your burning tongue like an ice-pack.  For dessert, we had the kala jamun and mango kulfi, both of which were icy in sensation and great after the burning meal.  Song of Fire and Ice, anyone?

They also serve cocktails, which will shore up your courage and make it so you're slightly less apprehensive about eating what you know is going to be authentic Indian spiciness.

I'm not even sure of the ingredients of half of what we ate, but it was all delicious, and we devoured it.  I recommend coming here with friends as you can order family-style and try even more dishes.

I would love to take my students here one day for a field trip to walk the grounds.

Mostly everything I have tried at Tandoori Times has been good. The naan is so fresh and warm, and when you request spicy, that's what you get. Enter the mango lassi, which is really good. It helps cool your mouth when you're eating something fiery.

The only thing I have a complaint about are the tandoori appetizer wings, as there was less meat on them than I have seen on any chicken wing, plus it was WAY too spicy. I also felt like $10 was way too much to ask when you have to basically get your nutrition from the dish by sucking on bones. But, hey...who am I to judge, right? Had they toned the flavor just a bit on that dish, I might have given it another try. However, bleeding from my esophagus is not how I'd like to spend my lunch hour.

My absolute favorite is their egg and potato breakfast burrito. Eat it with their delicious spicy hot sauce and you can't go wrong. Oh how I wish they were open Sundays. It would be the PERFECT hangover breakfast.

I have had their bean burrito which is okay. I'm not crazy about their beans. I have also had their cheese enchiladas which are not that great.

My husband says their machaca beef is pretty good and their green chili pork.

One of my favorite things to do for dinner for the fam is to order a dozen tortillas, and containers of their beans, rice, and green chili pork to-go, grill or saute some veggies, set out cheese and sour cream and let everyone go crazy. Easy, cheap, and tasty dinner.

The reviews here are so contradictory, I didn't know what to expect.  Since I'm far from a sushi snob (if it tastes good and doesn't make me sick, we're good!) I figured there was little to lose.  I was pleasantly surprised with the experience.

To start off, it was a little hard to find.  I was in the right parking lot, but literally watched the red dot on my phone map and drove around trying to line it up with the green one.  Finally found it.  The atmosphere inside was nice, it wasn't very busy so it was pretty relaxed.  Very Japanese decor.  We were seated immediately, and water came pretty quickly.

My one complaint of the evening was the long wait between getting the water and getting the menu.  When the waitress (who was very polite) brought them over, she explained that we could not get all-you-can-eat with our Groupon (sensible) but explained what it entailed for next time.  We ordered 6 or 7 rolls, 6 of which were very tasty.  The 7th...the Volcano Roll... was pretty weird.  It was spicy (not necessarily bad), sea-foody, and seemed to have been fired.  The flavor just wasn't what one expects with sushi.  The Arizona and Vegas rolls were great and the others were pretty good.

The total bill was very reasonable for 4 people for Sushi.  Take off the Groupon, and we got out for about $5 each.  If I go back with a big appetite, I'll definitely try the all-you-can-eat menu for $20.  And when I say ""if"", I mean ""when"".",4,2012-09-27 17:51

The toast can be a little dry without the mayo, but I'm willing to make that sacrifice. Mayo, blech. We always enjoy their very delicious iced coffee. We've also split pasties and muffins and they are choice.

The inside is a little cramped and ordering can be hectic, but once you find a space on their idyllic patio (seriously, so zen and dreamy), it's a breeze. We had our pup in tow on our most recent trip, and the patio is so dog friendly. Lots of head pats and other friendly doggos.

First off, let me start with the only positive thing I have for this restaurant...it has a very cool modern look and feel, which I like.
Now for the rest of our experience...the music is so loud you can barely hear anything else, so I opted to sit outside.  The patio is quite large, but has absolutely no shading from the sun, it's Arizona, the sun is out 95% of the year!  I had to move my son 3 times to try & keep the sun out of his eyes.  Next, it took over 10 minutes for anyone to come over & greet us, and take a drink order.  When the waiter finally came by, I could barely hear him or understand him because he was talking so soft, I swear he was on something by the way he was acting.  I asked if we could go ahead and place our food order since my son was getting really hungry & restless.  I ordered buttered noodles for my son and bacon and eggs for me, it took 40 minutes to get our food!!!  The place was not even that busy.  I will say that the eggs were really good, but when I picked up the bacon, the grease dripped off in a huge puddle, like it was not even drained off, yikes!  Now for my son's food, he will eat just about anything you put in front of him, but as soon as he put the noodles in his mouth he spit them right back out, I have no idea what they did to them, but he just wouldn't eat them.  I told the waiter when he finally walked by again that he just couldn't eat them & asked if I could I order something different & he said that was fine & he said he would take it off the check.  I asked him to see if they could rush it & 25 minutes later, still no food for my son, I called the waiter over & he said the kitchen was really busy & couldn't give him a timeframe as to when the food would be out (again, not a ton of people in there at this time), so I said to just cancel the new order & asked if I could have the check.  He brought the check & it still had the buttered noodles on it, so I called him over again and reminded him that he said he would take it off, he then proceeded to argue with me about taking it off the check, I asked to speak to a manager & he told me that no managers are employed there...what?!?!?!

We started with the homemade chips, which I believe are the same ones on the Culinary Dropout menu.  We like them.   He then had the roasted poplano chicken chowder.

When the waitress came to take our order, I pointed to the tin foil. She nodded and smiled widely, and I was excited to see what the big fuss was about.
Our waitress came back, and the tin foil was on fire. Yeah, fire. Wait, one more time in case that didn't come across, fire.
She moved the tin foil around, playing with the fire, and after a few seconds was able to open it.
I popped one of the sushi pieces into my mouth (is it still sushi if it's cooked?), and went ""Oh my God.....""
Hence the name, O.M.G. sushi. Can I describe how the outer flavored meshed together with the inner spices? Crab, eel, and shrimp, all my favorite things in one roll. 
That was my experience my first time at Harumi, and I have come back repeatedly since. Part of me hates reviewing this place because we come here so often and I don't want anyone else to come here because it's already a popular place, but Harumi deserves so much praise. It's one of our favorite date night spots because the service and food is amazing.  The staff is so friendly and sweet, and when we order sashimi we always receive huge chunks of fresh fish. The sushi is wrapped in purple rice, also known as Emperor's rice, because it used to be forbidden to all except royalty since the rice is super healthy, and that's just what they use for their regular rolls! If that were not enough, you can also order a Mini Roll Combo, where you can choose up to three different kinds of sushi to try! It's a great way to sample a few, and trust me they are all delicious, including the Phoenix, the Dragon, and the Las Vegas Roll. 
So at the risk of blowing up an already blown up date spot, go to Harumi, I'll probably already be there stuffing my face with their delicious sushi.",5,2017-06-13 20:43

First, the service was good, but it was at the end of the night, so I think the staff was tired and overlooked some things. Not a huge deal, but could be better. The food was good. we order a black garlic oil ramen bowl with extra noodles and an ikura bowl to share. The ramen broth was good, not too heavy yet not bland. The downside was the noodles. The noods were clumped together from not stirring enough while cooking. It would have been a perfect bowl if the noodles were cooked properly. The Ikura rice bowl was good too without any flaws.

I'd definitely come back again. Maybe not so close to closing because the quality in service is definitely diminished due to understandable fatigue from the staff.",4,2017-11-16 22:26

They have really good service and nice employees.  They accidentally put chicken on my sandwich once, and remade it for free and added a free large cookie even though I didn't ask for anything.  That's great customer service in my opinion, as most places don't go out of their way like that!  Plus I've ordered here a million times so they had already proven their track record to me.

Unfortunately, two of them were pretty soggy underneath.

I have always been very resistant to soy products and any form of faux meat.  It just always seemed so gross to me.  Due to a recent change in my lifestyle to be healthier, I have looked into healthier alternatives including what I used to turn my nose up at.  We saw a demonstration at Devoured by Chef Damon where he turned some of the weirdest ingredients (to me) into a beautiful yummy dish.  I had to see what else he had to offer.

First of all, the place is nothing like I expected.  I'm not sure why, but I was expecting something along the lines of True Food Kitchen.  Instead, it felt like a mess hall at some weird Liberal Arts school, and I say all that in a good way.  It's an order and pay at the counter then wait for your food at a table ordeal, which normally is fine by me.  Unfortunately the girl who had our food never bothered to call out the name we gave and instead walked around casually asking people who she thought might have ordered our dishes if it was theirs.  Finally she made her way to us after about five minutes.  That was annoying.

Forget about that though, because the food is good enough to make up for that little mishap.  (Other staff members seemed to call out names perfectly fine, just not that one.)  I ordered the Drunken Mushroom Chicken and grabbed an Oogave soda out of the cooler for my dinner.  The soda was great, and you can buy them at Sprouts, awesome.  The ""Chicken"" was expertly crafted with a texture almost identical to chicken and a taste just as close.  The breading around it was yummy, slightly crunchy, and a tiny bit sweet.  My bowl was packed full of delicious fresh veggies and loads of mushrooms.  There was also a generous helping of rice noodles buried in there too.  It was all fantastic, and I would eat it every night if I could.

Service on the weekend can be slow, but when I was here on a recent Friday morning, the restaurant was busy without being crowded, and the servers were attentive and prompt.  I've had the breakfast burrito crepe a couple times in the past (four stars - spicy, savory, and very filling!), and decided to get the andouille sausage one this time.  It was good -- generous amounts of sausage, a perfectly-cooked sunny-side-up egg on top, nice spicy kick -- but a little bit too salty.  I mentioned it to one of the servers, and she said it was just that the sausage itself was that salty; they don't salt the dish, except for a sprinkling of sea salt on top of the fried egg.  I ate about 90%, then put it aside to turn my attention to the lemon crepe.  I've had these before with just a simple spritz of lemon juice and a dusting of sugar, but Crepe Bar's version was a little more elaborate: the crepes had a kind of a lemon custard in them that was really good.  It was very sweet (could have been a little bit more tart, but still, I finished every bite!).  

Everything here is plated beautifully.  And, every time I've come here, a server has circulated around the restaurant offering free amuse bouche to diners.   This time, it was a maple coffee cake with vanilla custard; very nice!

The food is a little pricy, but it's clear that they care about quality and pay attention to details here. I will be back!",4,2013-11-09 19:04

I got:
Hummus - one of the best plates of hummus I have ever had
Dolmades - smaller than I am accustomed to, but they were almost meaty in consistency and taste, though it was vegetarian.
Tabbouleh - spooned helping after helping into my falafel pita, wonderful, crisp, just enough vinegar, refreshing
Falafel - freshly fried, hearty-tasting, I was fulfilled until the next morning

I understand that the crepe bar takes pride in their prevention on their menu items but when a guest wants to alter, or would like something in addition to what they are ordering; crepe bar should be more accommodating to the customer ordering there food, especially if the customer is willing to pay to have it done.  I usually always ask for more chipotle salt... Really can't have any extra? Always an issue. I know it comes on the side but yes I still would like a little more. The big factor that was upsetting to me with crepe bar this last visit wasn't so much the salt but was trying to order an additional EGG UP on the side. They told me they can't do that. We'll if you don't want to ruin the presentation to the order, then have it come on the side on a separate plate. IM PAYING for what I want! But they still told me NO.  Just because crepe bar thinks their items on the menu are the best served how they come, not everyone is the same or has the same taste. If someone wants to make a slight change or wants to BUY a side of an egg or whatever it may be, they should be more accommodating. I am a loyal guest of the crepe bar I always have invited friends and family to come experience their food with me, but won't be back for a while and won't be talking it up either.  

On top of not being able to order what I want, my toast was very burnt and the food didn't have quite the same flavor as it has in my past experiences.  Still enjoyed my food but that why I'm only giving this review a solid 3 stars.  

Hopefully their customer service gets better! The gentleman with red hair and glasses is always very kind and attentive to the guest. But other then that hopefully they can start learning how to say YES",3,2015-05-11 22:35

My husband and I decided to enjoy a Saturday evening happy hour before going to the movies.  

Tranquilo Cafe was the place to go for an amazing happy hour, not any more.  

The drink menu was margaritas (standard), selected wines and beers. 
Now the drink menu has gotten a lot shorter, scarce and more $$. 

The food selection was about ten appetizers that were  half price on the happy hour menu.  
Now the food selection has shrinked... Oh My! 

The kicker is the TACOS... They were half off but now they only serve the tacos half price on Tuesday!

To some people this isn't a big deal but to people who make happy hour a seque to dinner, this is a huge deal. 

When customer service was excellent and now I'm sitting at a table holding a menu for 20 mins before someone even noticed I didn't order.  

That's a PROBLEM....

Small place in an industrial area.  Big smoker out back and a line out the door.  Well it is a small place so more than 4 people and it is out the door.  They will need some shade in a week or two when it gets really hot out.  So i opted for the two meat plate.  Brisket, rib with my sides, potato salad and jalapeno cheddar grits.  Brisket was superb!  I was given a taste of the fatty brisket and it melted in my mouth.  I opted for both fatty and lean on my brisket plate.  By far the best BBQ i have had In AZ.  I am originally from Texas so this keeps on par with the good Texas BBQ.  I enjoyed all of it.  The potato salad was good not great, next time I think i'll try the beans.  Oh and they have Mexican Coke in a bottle!  Love that!  Their BBQ sauces are very good but not really needed.  The flavors in the meats are extremely good!

Womp womp. The area was in need of a good sandwich and salad shop with tasty beers and wines to rival it. So you can imagine my excitement when this place opened up... I love their homegrown feel and it is in the great Coronado neighborhood that I grew up in and am very proud of :) It is also officially the reason I don't really go to Carly's anymore... The Happy Hour features $2.50 drafts, aka, they offer danger :) The staff is friendly, the service is good, the menu ranges around $6-$9, yet features sandwiches with REAL ingredients on them. The Calvano, oh Mama mia! This New York-sized sandwich just makes my mouth water even thinking about it. I didn't know I loved sopressata before this sandwich existed. I always order some extra balsamic with my salad so that I can also add a little to the sandwich. Also, Mac and Cheese with EXTRA hatch chiles is the way to go for some extra tasty flavor. The salads are HUGE and DELIGHTFUL. Finally, three more words to sell you: Jalapeno cream cheese. Yes please, all over. It is featured on the TMI Toast and the Jive Turkey sandwich. They serve their food until midnight on the weekends for some late-night eats. The ambiance, flavor, the relaxed, yet on-it staff are the total package and a great addition to the neighborhood.",5,2011-05-24 22:02

Yes, I am, as of tonight because tonight I had a brisket sandwich and cheese enchilada from Tom's Thumb.  Lean and moist slices of brisket, a nice mix of charred edges and fall apart meat, infused with smoke, on Texas toast with garlic aioli, pickles, and onions.  Cheese enchiladas with a very spicy but absolutely awesome sauce.  Both with shoestring fries.

Burgers, pulled pork, BBQ chicken, brisket, salads, tacos, vegetarian options, mac and cheese, platters, and a selection of BBQ sauces on the side.  The thought of their smoked meat chili almost makes me want to get in my car and go back right now.

Our appetizer order of spring rolls and edamame came out really fast. The spring rolls were veggie and had some thin glass noodles in it, which was a nice surprise. The edamame was decently warm and salted.

The rolls came out not too long after. We ordered the spicy tuna, Las Vegas, shrimp tempura and California rolls. Out of all of the rolls, I liked the Las Vegas roll best. The quality of fish was decent for being in the desert. The shrimp tempura roll came with this sauce, which I thought was spicy mayo, but it tasted more like mayo mixed with ketchup...not a big fan of that sauce on sushi. You can't really mess up spicy tuna, which was a good amount of spice.

My mom also ordered shrimp Yakisoba. It was pretty oily and didn't have many vegetables at all. There was a good amount of small shrimp, but the only vegetables in the noodle dish were lots of carrot slices and a few pieces of cabbage.

They do offer an all you can eat sushi option for about $21 per person. Sounds enticing, but not sure if I'd try their sushi again. There is also the option for teppanyaki, where they cook on a flat top in front of you, so that might be an option to come back and try the place out again.",3,2016-06-30 2:14

A bad attitude is forgivable if the food is exceptional and that did not happen in this case.

Based on the recommendations I felt that the beef pies and green onion pancake were just so- so. I did like the hot chili sauce but it was just carb-overload and not a ton of flavor for those 2 dishes. If I had to pick favorites it would have to be the dumplings.

I went to Grazie on a Saturday night with no reservations with about 18 other people. Lo and behold, we were all seated with a bunch of tables lined up diagonally on the patio. That, to me, is impressive, given what everyone wrote here about it not being a group kind of place.

Apparently the owner of Grazie and the owner of Cibo used to be business partners and then they fell out and now have competing pizzerias. Things you learn when natives are in your midst. 

Anyway, the ambiance was decent and nowhere near as Scottsnoxious as some nearby environs. I had the Marcello pizza which was pretty basic and was made in typical authentic Italian style. It didn't blow my socks off but I'd definitely eat it again. But the real reason some folks in the group took us there was to experience the calzone. 

Not a calzone for dinner. A calzone for dessert. Filled with bananas & nutella, and topped with vanilla ice cream. I thought the combination of salty calzone shell with the sweetness of everything else was interesting and pretty good, but hot damn was it was the hardest thing to cut through. Seriously, within 5 seconds each calzone looked like that one Gremlin which exploded in the microwave (don't remember? Netflix the movie again!). Now I've had better nutella/banana desserts elsewhere, but this was still a tasty morsel. Albeit not the most user-friendly one.

All in all, I found the prices agreeable and on par with similar places throughout the Valley, and the service was fast and really efficient for such a mass of people. I'd give it another shot and come back again - just next time maybe not in a group of 19. N-n-n-n-19.",3,2007-04-24 2:19

I was really looking forward to trying this place after checking out their menu online.  Really cool atmosphere, but be warned, it was loud.  I had to lean in to talk to my bf next to me and it was next to impossible to hear what the group was saying at the other end of the table.  Our service experience was interesting.  They have only been open about a month and I could tell they still had a few kinks to work out.  For starters they ran out of menus.  They told us this off the bat so for our group of 10 we only had 5 menus for the table.  At one point in the evening, a server came up to me and asked if he could have my menu so he could give it to another table.  Not a huge deal, but really?  Not having enough menu's especially on a Friday night?
Our server was a little bizarre. He was really over the top and theatrical but in an off putting way.  He was efficient but a little cringey.  We ordered an array of appetizers,pastas and sides to share and yes, the portions are very small.  With the pasta dishes I was able to have exactly 1 noodle per dish. Still very delicious though.  For my main dish I ordered the Creekstone Filetto.

The staff is also very attentive. They check on your need often and clear out empty plates promptly. The thing that stood out most was the number of customers who are regulars.

Awesome restaurant, basically a renovated house turned into a restaurant. I really like when restaurants have that type of layout. Happy hour was really great too. Their draft beers are normally $6, but on happy hour they are only $3. They have some legit drafts too so this is probably one of the best happy hour beer prices for good quality beer. 

The food is where it went a little downhill for me. I got the green chili stew and I think I was just expecting something different. It had flavor and a good amount of green chilis, but I was hoping for more of a green chili sauce to be the base and it was more of a chunky stew. Maybe it was just me but I guess I was just expecting more of a soup consistency. It was  served with two corn tortillas on the side. My wife ordered a sandwich with turkey and salami and she liked it. I thought that the roasted turkey had a weird flavor but the salad dressing was really flavorful.

Right off of Indian School, the parking lot is pretty small for the size of the place. I've never had too much trouble coming after work, but I imagine it gets pretty dicey on the weekends. Walking into The Porch, it's definitely a casual environment and a good place to throw back a couple beers and some bar food. They've got a handful of arcade games (golden tee and the like) in a corner, in case you want to escape your table for a couple minutes. 

Like I said, it's hard to beat a $4 beer special, especially when they've got Dead Guy on tap. The pretzel is also excellent, gigantic and delicious. Would highly recommend. This last time, I opted for the Porch Burger ($7 on happy hour). It was fine, not super notable--a little salt and pepper goes a long way, friends--but the bun was good. I don't know if it was just smaller because it was happy hour, but it was a pretty petite burger (and I'm a very petite person) that I probably would've been kinda upset paying full price for at that size. The fries were excellent, and I'm 100% a fry snob.

Being somewhat new to Arizona we were recommended to this place by a couple coworkers. We had a 730 reservation and when we got there at exactly 730, the place was packed and we were told that they were waiting for our table to leave. That's fine. We get it. We stood outside and waited. The table was finally ready at about 10 minutes to 8. But that was fine. We sat down at a table in the middle of the restaurant and our server, Sam , came over and greeted us. We ordered some wine to get things going as we looked over the menu. The person who brought the wine forgot one glass, but was so nice it didn't matter. A little while later Sam came back to see how we were doing. My parents don't go out much and were very overwhelmed. Between the 4 of us we had a zillion questions for the poor guy. And most of us took his recommendations. We started with bruschetta. Very tasty and actually good for sharing. You get to pick out 4 that you would like for $13. We got the smoked salmon with capers, the prosciutto with arugula, tomatoes and mascarpone, the fig and almond with ricotta and the date and goat cheese. So wonderful. Amazing. I could have eaten those all night long. But just as we finished those someone walked up with the meatballs and eggplant rollatini. Both items were awesome. The eggplant was filled with ricotta cheese and just delicious. And the meatballs were as tasty as a meatball could be. And decent portions too. I think we got 3 or 4 meatballs and they were huge! And the eggplant dish was also big enough where no one felt they were left out of it. On to the entrees. Mom had the Bria pizza. Although a she's not a vegetarian, she seems to pretend she is when she eats out. So that was perfect for her. Dad got the mushroom risotto which he loved and said was packed with mushrooms. Boyfriend got arrabiata with Italian sausage. He loved it but said it wasn't spicy like he thought it would be. Then again his spice tolerance is pretty high. I had one of the weekly specials. It was scallops estate (?). So good. Four jumbo scallops on a bed of linguine and julienned zucchini in a garlic, butter sauce. Couldn't go wrong. However we were stuffed. Sam took all of our plates and boxed them up. Chad had told Sam at some point that it was my birthday. I went to clean up after eating and when I came back chad said that they didn't do anything for birthdays there. That was fine by me as I was stuffed. So Sam came back with all our food boxed up and he was so nice and was chatting with us. When he walked away he said he would be right back with something sweet for me. You should have seen my face. Boyfriend got me good. What he brought out was amazing! Zeppole I think is what it was called. It was some combination of mini donuts, churros, croissants. I don't even know. And it had raspberry and chocolate dipping sauce. And it too was huge!!! So delicious. I was on cloud nine. Boyfriend and I will be back for date night.

Worth it.

I also got a sea salt brownie (shoutout to Tigra for mentioning it!) and it was good.

The restaurant looks like a hole in the wall in a little shopping plaza but the food is incredibly delicious and the service is great. You will not be disappointed!!!!,5,2017-06-16 4:06

(Chinese Restaurant News). That is more locations than McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and Taco Bell COMBINED! You can't please everyone!

In four visits I have been pleased by each and am now a ""Regular."" The most pleasing of their dishes that I have tried are:

              Cold Spicy Noodles and Cucumbers -  BEST Noodle Dish I have EVER 
              had! Almost addictive!

              Dumplings of Any Kind - (Ask for ""Soup Dumplings"" - XLB = Xiao Long 
              Bao, NOT on the menu but THE BEST!)

              Chicken Fried Rice- FABULOUS!

              Orange Chicken -  consider putting it over that Fried Rice.

             Beef or Pork Pies - A bit disappointing, given the hype, but Good

             Pot Stickers - Not as well done as I like, but GOOD!) 

I was disappointed in the Chive or Green Onion Pancakes, but others rave about them.

A gem of a find to be certain!",4,2013-04-26 0:59

Went in because my boyfriend bought the living social deal. The bartender who waited on us was nice and helpful and my margarita was delicious! 

The salsa has a hint of chipotle. Not bad but different than what you'd imagine. I had the agave enchiladas and I really liked them. The pork was excellent and so were the sauces on top. My boyfriend had the impressive chimichanga. It was absolutely huge - definitely enough for two. We both left with to go boxes. And my left overs were great for lunch today :)

The queso was alright- spinach queso isn't my favorite kind of queso but my boyfriend seemed to like it. 
 
It wasn't very busy either which was disappointing to see. I would guess its location that's hurting them but if you are the area, it's definitely worth a stop by. I will visit again if I am ever in that area :)",4,2015-08-14 23:18

The menu is huge so if you come with a med-large party, theres going to be something for everyone. They have a good selection of beer and a full bar. They have a great Raspberry Cider that my wife loves! The bar area is great for happy hour and a game.

Bad: They call this a brewery...and it isnt. Its a restaurant that serves beer that the OTHER BJ's makes. This might not matter to you but it does to me. Weak! Because they're not an actual brewery, their liquor license is different and they cant fill the BJ's growler that I bought. Oh well, I'll use it to hold my change and I'll get my other growlers filled at real breweries. We've also experienced ""Dirty Lines"" here before.

We ended up at this OHOP for breakfast around 11am (on a Sunday).  We were lucky enough to get a parking spot and a table within just a few minutes.  Once seated, I noticed how tacky the interior is decorated, but that is no big deal.  The big deal is that the tables are so close together there is not much room to move... and that the place doesn't take credit cards, and if you order a couple of things ala carte like we did, it really adds up... 

My short stack for buckwheat pancakes, scrambled egg whites, and OJ plus Jared's eggs over easy with hashbrowns, toast, and coffee cost us $32 before tip.  For breakfast?  Really?  And our waitress could've told us, but no...

At least they made it easy by putting an ATM inside the restaurant now - too bad there is that additional $2.50 fee to use it.  

Another difference I noticed is that OHOP offers only one single kind of syrup where IHOP offers many... and the pancakes are better at the latter as well.  The one thing that OHOP has going for them is their Dutch Baby - at least from the looks of it as I saw people around me ordering it.  

I'll choose IHOP or one of the many locally owned breakfast places in the future before returning to OHOP.  It was $40 out the door for a simple breakfast for two today... Screw that!",2,2009-01-25 19:24

The sweet potato fries are definitely the best I can find in Central Phoenix and I really, really love the Strawberry Tallcake - sweetly sinful!

My biggest gripe with this place is the service.  There are three or four waiters (all men!) who are always, without fail, truly outstanding.  The women, however, have been reliably less-than-stellar.  I don't know why there seems to be such a split in level of service, but I've come to expect it.  The women have never been outright terrible, but they are less friendly, slow, and a lot less responsive than the men.  Last time I was there with a friend (his first visit), one of the women who appeared to be a manager-type instead of a server, hovered around our table and watched us while we ate.

However, Chino Bandido beat me to it. 
Gosh darn; I wish I thought of it first! 

There are several options to choose from; from just your choice of entree by itself to putting it in your quesadilla or burrito or BOTH! What if you don't know how these entrees taste like? No problem, ask for a sample. That's how I made my choice. Did I hear with a side of refried or black beans and rice on the side? Yes you did!  For the rice, you get some more options; fried, plain, jerk, and chicken. To wrap it all up you get to choose either a chocolate volcano (chocolate cookie with powder sugar) or snicker doodle cookie. At the end of it all, you will definitely be really full. I had to take a power nap; haha. 

I had the Jade Chicken (which is the most popular entree on the menu) entree with Jade Chicken quesadilla with a side of black beans and jerk fried rice. Finishing it all up with a volcano chocolate cookie. I liked the snicker doodler more though (my boyfriend had it) . 

I really like the Jade Chicken. It was freshly made crispy; but there was a little too much sauce. I find the quesadilla very unique. I never had Chinese food with cheese with tortilla before.

#NAME?,NFgvM7LMx5Ocsxr7J2_sVA,44YFU284Z3KDEy25QyVoUw,"After opening all our gifts and eating a big Christmas lunch the family decided they wanted some dinner.  Well, we didn't have much left in the way of leftovers, and since we were at my mom's, there wasn't much to chose from otherwise in the fridge (she is a minimalist when it comes to food).  My dad had been having a hankering for some fried rice for the past few weeks, which worked out since it seems the only restaurants that are open on Christmas are Chinese!

Nee House is near my folks, so we called up and placed an order to go.  We were told that it would be 45 minutes to an hour until it was ready...yikes!  My dad and my sister left to go pick it up after about 40 minutes.....and they were gone for a really, really long time!  I guess the place was a madhouse, and if you wanted a table you had to wait in a line for a table!  They sat at the bar and waited...and finally after sitting there about 45 minutes they finally got the food (note to self: never try to order Chinese food on Christmas again!).

When they got home we were all hoping that the food would make up for the wait....and well, it did!  We got the hot & sour soup as well as the War Wonton, both were excellent, although the hot & sour could have used a bit more heat.

The house fried rice was awesome, cooked perfectly, with lots of meat and it wasn't greasy at all, which is very unusual for fried rice.  We also got mu shu pork (this was the best I have ever had) and some sesame chicken.  It was breaded, but it wasn't greasy at all, and the sauce was just sweet enough, but not overpowering.  We had ordered some crab puffs, and they were good, but they had forgotten to give us the dipping sauce, which would have made them that much better.

Overall, except for the long wait, we found Nee house to be really good.  My dad brought home a menu for us to look at, and it has one of the most expansive menus I have ever seen at a Chinese restaurant, including a lot of seafood dishes.  My dad was happy to have gotten his fried rice fix...and I have a feeling he will be going back again soon.",4,2010-01-05 20:32

12:30pm on a Friday and there was no line. Another bad sign... 

The atmosphere was bright, urban hipster. That's cool. The service was prompt and friendly. Lots of goodies in the display case. Yay! Things are looking up.

The Blackberry Jasmine Green Tea was crisp and fresh. Only sat for a few minutes when my food was delivered and boy, did it look good!  Unfortunately, that's where the good part ends...

It may have been the prettiest Tuna Melt I've eaten in a long time but it was also one of the worst. I used five napkins--FIVE!--to sop up all the dripping mayonnaise from this tuna salad that was spewing all over my plate/side salad/table/lap. Yuck. When are restaurants going to learn that you only put enough mayo in tuna salad to hold the ingredients together??? I'm sorry, but if you hold up a tuna sandwich and it all drips out, you've done something wrong. Such a shame because it really did look pretty on the plate... 

I was even more disappointed to find that they drenched the side salad in WAY too much balsamic dressing, so I abandoned that completely.

And the final nail in the coffin was the ""Ncounter"" signature dessert which is a combination brownie/oreo/chocolate-chip cookie. It was $4 and I only took one bite. SO DRY! Ugh.

This may be the most flavorful array of proteins I've ever had. The pulled pork and brisket are a must. And the beef rib is certainly something to behold! Even the sides (we had potato salad, mac and cheese, garlic broccoli, beans, and cornbread) were mild and pure in their taste.

It was a tad pricey, but I guess it is expected in this location.  $22 for for a lemonade, 1/2 a salad and 1/2 a Panini is a little steep, but it is what it is.

My friend got the bruschetta board...it was amazing as well.  I tried a piece of the artichoke one and it was out of this world.

Overall, it was solid.",4,2016-06-29 19:39
73eUo3HvxU1o-xnWqvlIeQ,LVFmC7HQo1oEe7i69PW5VQ,qQCsLGMncJp1xWUGnOKCQA,"10/2 update - My husband and I went here for dinner a couple weeks ago.  The food and wine were fantastic and a great value.  We ate inside - what a cozy, friendly atmosphere, and the service was superb.  It felt like family but without all the annoying family members.   Also on our way in, we noticed the misters on the patio so maybe we were too dumb and/or oblivious to notice them on our previous visit.  All in all, a yummy, romantic, fun dinner so I've upgraded it a star.  We will be back!  Btw if you like serious food porn and occasionally Facebook only specials, like them on Facebook.  

**********************************
We enjoyed brunch here today and would give this more stars if the service had been better.  The food and drinks were great.  I had the yogurt and granola which was yummy.  My husband had the breakfast croissant which he said was good.  We topped it off with mimosas and a cappuccino.  Prices are reasonable.  

The place is as everyone else has described - totally unexpected cute, cozy place in a rundown shopping center.  We had our dogs so sat on the patio which is nice and makes you feel you aren't next to a busy intersection but really needs misters.

One guy at the counter was great though harried.  He was efficient, very enthusiastic and nice, even bringing treats for our dogs.  The girl - not so much.  She wasn't friendly, was way in the weeds in terms of service, and for some reason, felt it appropriate to yell at the nice guy in front of all the customers.  Apparently there was some separation of duties that he wasn't respecting, but it was clear she was in the weeds badly and needed help.  

We were really happy to support a local business and will go here again.  They do need to address the service issues as several reviewers have pointed out.  The drive-thru was constantly busy while we were there, and there was a good crowd inside.  We were the only ones on the patio.  They need to find a balance between serving the drive-thru and inside customers.  I cannot imagine how they could've handled it if the patio and inside were full in addition to the drive-thru.

One last thing - I think they could turn the music volume down just a touch.  All in all, we enjoyed our visit and will definitely be back!",5,2012-06-16 23:27

The food was fine except the potatoes were rock hard and dry.  When I tried to cut one it launched from the plate onto the floor.  The potatoes are served in a very small dish that makes cutting them more difficult.

I was expecting the standard buffet items (which they had) but I also saw a few things that are not. Always a fan of Chicken Tikka Masala they also had a Paneer version, yum! They had some really good seasoned roasted jalapenos that made a great addition to the plate, added nice heat and flavor to the dishes. In addition to the naan on the table they also offered Puri at the buffet. This was a nice option. 
The desert was different, it was white and had a distinct rosewater flavor to the syrup.  I am used to the softer donut hole type, Gulab Jamun, in a cardamon honey syrup.  This I have come to find out was Rasgulla.
I definite enjoyed the variety and the quality of the food. Not enough for 4 stars but I would go back if in the area and craving Indian cuisine.",3,2010-07-01 23:09

I started my dinner with frozen Thai Mai.  When the server said something about pineapple, it sounded sweet and good.  It sure was yummy. I think I like drinks with pineapple.

For my dinner, I ordered honey walnut crispy shrimp with brown rice (dinner choice is jasmine or brown rice).  She mentioned with extra dollars, they can substitute to fried rice.  They put main dish over rice when they serve (it doesn't come separately), I thought fried rice will change the main dish taste.

Friendly service with nice smiles. I can't explain it but I just felt pleasantly comfortable dining there. 

When it came time to pay, the server swiped a card by my table. I just thought it was comforting (although I wasn't doubting anything) that she didn't have to walk away with customers' credit card.

It was weekday dinner but they were busy, so I sat at the outside patio (with heater of course...)  As I walked back inside to leave, I saw the sign Toledo 1,900 miles...(can't remember the exact numbers).  It just made me smile. I didn't know but Louie is from Toledo.

All you have to do is order at the counter where all the assorted off-menu pastries are and pay using the square attached to the iPad. You can have the receipt emailed or printed. It gives you a suggested tip too! 

The staff brought out their homemade CB cereal made of granola and dried fruit served in a teeny tiny bowl (the size of a sake cup) with whole milk and baby spoons to use all presented on a slate board. And then came their porridge with some barley and oats of some sort served cold in a bowl that was a bit bigger. A sweet sensation. 

Now comes the crepes!!
Savory: Shared the Chicken Pesto with white cheddar, skinny caramelized onions and slivered circle red onions; and the Smokey (with turkey, smoked gouda, avocado and chorizo) each encased in a the thin crepe. Both were accompanied with a mini simple greens. Smokey had a more robust flavor from the smoked gouda while the chicken pesto was searching for more of the pesto. 

Sweet: Pick Me Up-- this is very innovative as far as infusing the coffee into the crepe with a shiny coffee glaze alongside the espresso mascarpone waiting on the sides of the plate dusted with the 5 spice crumble. This will pick you up if you didn't get the coffee already! 

I would love to come back here again!! There is more to try like the Grand Prix, 13mi, and Lemon Drop! This is an appealing hang out place to eat, chat and sip on coffee!",5,2014-05-06 3:28

""This is such an American thing to do,"" she said, ""taking the most unhealthy things from different cultures, then smothering them with cheese."" I didn't hear any complaints in that sentence, really. Chino Bandido is an all-American idea. It's like a bacon and peanut butter sandwich, a deep fried oreo, a Coney Island hot dog eating contest. 

It's just genius. The jade red chicken on it's own is wonderful, but pairing it with black beans or putting it in a gooey cheese quesadilla just enhances the whole experience. And, though my foreign friend laughed, she was happy to box up the leftovers for the next day!

I think the icing on top of this patriotic cake was really the warm snickerdoodle that comes with every meal. My friends have this crazy rule that you smash the cookie with your fist, because it's really fluffy and it makes it bigger if you squish it down a little. There's really no science behind it, but maybe we can start a trend?

I got the cornbread enchiladas, a unique concept in and of itself, with the red sauce. The red sauce had a very mellow heat that didn't overpower the flavor and meshed well with the slightly sweet cornbread.

Anyways, I ordered the Breakfast Tacos with Brisket. I mean really, you can't go wrong with steak and eggs, right? Upon receiving my tacos, I was pleasantly surprised. The plate looked great. After that, it was mediocre at best. It was just....'meh'. Since it was over priced for what is essentially breakfast comfort food ($6.50 plus a $2 charge for the Brisket) and they managed to make what should have been fantastic into a disappointment, I can't see why I would go back.

We opted to have dinner at Noodles Ranch and dine in.  The restaurant was busy on a Saturday night, but we were seated quickly.  

That was the only thing quick about the experience.  Actually, our orders were also taken quickly, but service went downhill from there.  Our spring rolls arrived, and I had to ask for napkins as there were no utensils on the table.  The food runner almost looked confused and brought over a few pathetic scraps of paper usually found in a dispenser.  So I was off on a rant over that...especially when I looked down and saw a full-sized sucker on the floor.  I guess we weren't worthy.  Food took forever, but when it finally arrived we realized again we had no utensils.  My husband spotted some chopsticks and took matters into his own hands to retrieve them.  No one ever came by to check if we needed anything, and my husband who by now should have put an apron on, found soy sauce for me.  The check arrived slowly and without an offer of dessert.  

Why four stars you ask?  Because I really did enjoy the food.  The spring rolls were okay, but our entrees were great.  My husband ordered a special of noodles and yellow curry with chicken.  The curry was spicy and flavorful.  I was sort of jealous.  I had the Yakisoba with seafood. They skimped on the shrimp, but there was plenty of chicken and pork (the pork was my favorite anyway) and lots of veggies.

I ordered the chicken bacon panini and with every bite, it got better and better! The bread was toasty but soft on the inside, the chicken had great seasoning, the boursin and jack cheese combo was out of this world, and bacon is ..well, bacon.

I love the idea of CB: Mexican Asian Fusion.  My favorite part about this place is the mini tour of the flavors you're taken on if you let them know that you're new. I loved being able to taste so much stuff: Carnitas, Jerk Fried Rice, Jade Red Chicken, Black Beans, etc.  The dish I most wanted to try, Pollo Diablo, was not on the tasting menu, but other thigns were tasty.  I also like that with the combination meals, you can get two meat items and get them served plain (over rice), in a burrito, or in a quesadilla.  Adding cheese to stuff is almost always a good idea, but not to asian flavored meats. That's weird.

We ordered two combinations with Carnitas, Jerk Chicken, Jen Red Pork, and the Pollo Diablo. Quick summary:
-Carnitas: pretty flavorful; one of the better dishes
-Jerk Chicken: a bit on the dry side and not as spicy as advertised.  Perhaps we roll too hot for most places.
-Jen Red Pork: Crispy on the outside, mostly tender inside. A sweet, warmish sauce. Not bad at all.
-Pollo Diablo: This was supposed to be my star (thanks Guy Fieri for hyping it!). It was spicier than the others, but not necessarily more flavorful.  It was dry in the burrito, so I opened up the tortilla and munched on it plain.  More moist, but mostly oily moist and very little flavor otherwise.
-Black beans: pretty flavorful but the consistency of grout. Seriously. These beans lined the walls of my stomach and wouldn't leave!
-Free cookie!  DId you say free?  Cookie?  Yay! Chocolcate Volcano cookie was nothing like a volcano, but yummy nonetheless!

I love the idea and love the friendly service.  I don't love the meh flavors or the way my stomach felt for the rest of the day: gut-bomb city!
